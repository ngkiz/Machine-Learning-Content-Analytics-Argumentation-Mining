            "Abstract",
            "Background/aims: The aim of this prospective study was to estimate gender differences in anxiety, depression, and alcohol use severity among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) before and after detoxification program and within 12 months after discharge.",
            "Methods: AUD severity, state and trait anxiety, and depression were assessed in 187 patients entering an inpatient alcohol detoxification program.",
            "Follow-up assessments were performed at 6 and 12 months after discharge.",
            "A between- and within-subjects analyses explored gender differences.",

            "Based on these principles, it is clear that finding a violation of the prohibition of discrimination in forced sterilization cases is critical in addressing the systemic nature of the practice, acknowledging the marginalization of specific groups and effectively ending forced sterilization through addressing the underlying purpose of the practice.",

            "In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), as of 2016, there were nearly one million WLHIV, but the existing evidence of their SRH needs comes from a few individual studies.",
            "This systematic review provides an overview of these women's needs to help define new and/or adapt existing public health strategies to the local context.",
            "This review synthesizes the evidence from the literature on the use of and access to SRHS related to family planning, antenatal care, abortion services and violence against WLHIV in LAC.",
            "Methods: Using a systematic review of mixed studies, a search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, INASP, POPLINE, SCOPUS, for studies conducted in LAC, from 2004 to 2017, as well as contact with authors and hand search as needed.",

            "Data from individual studies reported unmet family planning needs; higher, but inconsistent use of condom as the sole contraceptive method OR=1.46 [1.26 to 1.69]; lesser use of other non-permanent contraceptive methods OR=0.26 [0.22 to 0.31]; more unplanned pregnancies OR=1.30 [1.02 to 1.66]; more induced abortions OR=1.96 [1.60 to 2.39]; higher risk of immediate postpartum sterilization; and higher exposure to sexual and institutional violence by WLHIV when compared with women without HIV.",

            "Free-text survey comments and narrative interviews were analysed thematically using constant comparison.",

            "Purpose: Prior studies have found that women in academic medicine do not advance or remain in their careers in parity with men.",
            "The authors examined a cohort of faculty from the 1995 National Faculty Survey to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty.",
            "Method: The authors followed 1,273 faculty at 24 medical schools in the continental United States for 17 years to identify predictors of advancement, retention, and leadership for women faculty.",
            "Schools were balanced for public or private status and the four Association of American Medical Colleges geographic regions.",
            "The authors used regression models to adjust for covariates: seniority, department, academic setting, and race/ethnicity.",
            "Results: After adjusting for significant covariates, women were less likely than men to achieve the rank of professor (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78) or to remain in academic careers (OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94).",
            "When number of refereed publications was added to the model, differences by gender in retention and attainment of senior rank were no longer significant.",
            "Male faculty were more likely to hold senior leadership positions after adjusting for publications (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69).",
            "Conclusions: Gender disparities in rank, retention, and leadership remain across the career trajectories of the faculty cohort in this study.",
            "Women were less likely to attain senior-level positions than men, even after adjusting for publication-related productivity.",
            "Institutions must examine the climate for women to ensure their academic capital is fully utilized and equal opportunity exists for leadership."

            "Understanding determinants of gender differences in economic and social domains has been of interest, both in academic and public debates.",
            "Previous research has shown that gender differences in fundamental economic preferences are important in explaining gender differences in economic outcomes, such as for occupational choice, financial investment, or educational decisions, among many others.",

            "RATIONALE",
            "We contrasted and tested two hypotheses that make opposite predictions concerning the cross-country association of gender differences in preferences with economic development and gender equality.",
            "On one hand, the attenuation of gender-specific social roles that arises in more developed and gender-egalitarian countries may alleviate differences in preferences between women and men.",
            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be negatively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (social role hypothesis).",
            "On the other hand, greater availability of material and social resources removes the gender-neutral goal of subsistence, which creates the scope for gender-specific ambitions and desires.",
            "In addition, more gender-equal access to those resources may allow women and men to express preferences independently from each other.",
            "As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be positively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (resource hypothesis).",
            "We tested these competing predictions using data on experimentally validated measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples.",
            "So that the data would be geographically representative, the dataset was chosen so as to include all continents and a broad range of cultures and economic development levels.",
            "In total, the data represent about 90% of both the world population and global income.",
            "RESULTS",
            "The data revealed substantial cross-country variation in gender differences in preferences.",
            "Gender differences were found to be strongly positively associated with economic development as well as gender equality.",
            "These relationships held for each preference separately as well as for a summary index of differences in all preferences jointly.",
            "Quantitatively, this summary index exhibited correlations of 0.67 (P < 0.0001) with log GDP per capita and 0.56 (P < 0.0001) with a Gender Equality Index (a joint measure of four indices of gender equality), respectively.",
            "To isolate the separate impacts of economic development and gender equality, we conducted a conditional analysis, finding a quantitatively large and statistically significant association between gender differences and log GDP per capita conditional on the Gender Equality Index, and vice versa.",

            "Introduction",
            "Life expectancy (LE) at birth reflects the overall mortality level of a population.",
            "It summarizes the mortality patterns and health outcomes of various population groups such as women and men.",
            "Thus, LE can indicate health inequalities in the population.",
            "Even in the European Union (EU) with common goals and values and a common economic area, LE still differs between countries, and varies along sociodemographic variables.",
            "To reduce inequalities is a matter of fairness and as such should be of public interest.",
            "This paper puts gender inequalities in the focus.",
            "In EU 28 Member States LE at birth reached 83.3 years (women) and 77.9 years (men) on average in 2015.1 The gender gap in life expectancy (GGLE) at birth has narrowed from 6.4 years (2002) to 5.4 years (2015) on EU average but the size of this gender gap still varies substantially in Europe.1 As biological differences appear to play a minor role in explaining the GGLE,2,3 differences in social relationships or health-risk behaviour gain attention.4,5",
            "Men benefit more than women from the expansion of LE.",
            "For example, in the Netherlands, male LE increased between 1990 and 2015 by 8%, female LE by 4%.",
            "In other EU countries a comparable trend can be observed.",
            "As possible theoretical explanations for this trend, diminishment of gender inequality,3 role expansion theory (undertaking of different social roles such as paid work, child care and household activities),3 or convergence in unhealthy behaviours (reduction of risk behaviour in men, adoption of risk behaviour in women or both) are discussed.4 Social relationships and health-risk behaviour are shaped by social norms but studies on the influence of societal factors on LE are rare.6 Gender inequality, i.e.",
            "unequal distribution of wealth, power and benefits among women and men, is one of the most important societal factors.",
            "Gender inequality is socially determined and as such it is open to change by gender equality policies.7 Some studies have shown an association between gender inequality and health indicators on a national or international level.",
            "Gender inequality is associated with child and infant mortality8,9 as well as with men\u2019s health.3 Our paper addresses the question of whether gender inequality is also interrelated with the GGLE as well as to LE in both genders.",
            "The rationale is that gender differences in health related behaviours contribute to the gender gap in mortality and thus to LE, as behaviour is influenced by gender norms.",
            "We hypothesize that the GGLE is smaller in countries with more gender equality.",
            "With our analysis we want to contribute to the debate on reducing health inequalities between women and men.",
            "Methods",
            "We conducted an ecological study to investigate the association between gender inequality and (gender gap in) LE at birth in EU 28 Member States.",
            "To assess gender inequality we used the gender inequality index (GII) produced by the United Nations Development Programme with data from 2015 being the most recent available.",
            "The GII measures loss of human development in three dimensions with five indicators: reproductive health (maternal mortality ratio, adolescent birth rate), political empowerment (share of parliamentary seats held by each sex, attainment at secondary and higher education levels) and economic status (labour market participation rate).",
            "It ranges from 0, where women and men score equally, to 1, where one gender scores as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions.10 We calculated the GGLE (2015) by subtracting the LE of men from that of women.",
            "Using GII scores and GGLE data we computed Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient and created a scatter plot.",
            "Results",
            "In EU 28 Member States, on average the GGLE is 5.4 years in 2015.",
            "The range is 3.3 years (Netherlands) to 10.5 years (Lithuania).",
            "In 2015 the GII varies for EU 28 member states between 0.041 (Denmark) and 0.339 (Romania).",
            "Figure 1 shows the association between GGLE and GII.",
            "There is a positive weak correlation between the magnitude of GGLE and higher GII values (r2 = 0.180).",
            "Analysing the correlation of female resp.",
            "male LE with GII separately, shows even a stronger, moderate correlation coefficient of 0.418 (women) and 0.430 (men) (see Appendix).",
            "Conclusions",
            "The results show a positive, although weak correlation between GGLE and GII in the expected direction: the lower the gender inequality on a national level the smaller the GGLE.",
            "Gender inequality is not only associated with the GGLE but also with the LE itself.",
            "The correlation is even stronger than the association between GGLE and GII.",
            "Both results indicate that gender inequality is related to the health of women and men.",
            "The fact that in men a moderate correlation between LE and GII can also be observed, proves a positive association between gender equality and men\u2019s health.",
            "It could be cautiously interpreted that convergence of behaviours as well as expansion of roles as consequences of increasing gender equality might influence the LE of women and men.",
            "The limitation of the study is that the health dimension \u2018maternal mortality ratio\u2019 is part of the GII.",
            "The maternal mortality ratio itself affects the LE of women in the direction that higher maternal mortality ratios lead to lower life expectancies for women and thus to a reduction of the GGLE.",
            "However, the maternal mortality ratio is rather low in EU 28 Member States and differs between three deaths per 100 000 live births (Finland, Greece and Poland) and 31 death per 100 000 live births (Romania).",
            "Therefore, the influence on LE seems limited.",
            "Our results show that gender inequality affects LE in men and women as well as the GGLE.",
            "Conflicts of interest: None declared.",
            "Key points",
            "The GGLE varies substantially in Europe.",
            "LE in men and women and gender equality are correlated: the higher the gender equality, the higher the LE in both sexes.",
            "There is a positive correlation between magnitude of GGLE and higher values of GII."

            "METHODS",
            "We report the cases of two women with FGM/C types II and III who requested clitoral reconstruction for different reasons.",
            "One woman hoped to improve her chronic vulvar pain, as well as improve her sexual response.",

            "At 1-year postoperatively, the first woman reported complete disappearance of vulvar pain and improved sexual pleasure, including orgasm.",
            "Our second patient also described improved sexuality at 1-year follow-up (increased sexual desire, lubrication, vulvar pleasure, and sensitiveness), which she attributed to a better self body image and confidence.",

            "Background: Although Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) is internationally considered a harmful practice, it is increasingly being medicalized allegedly to reduce its negative health effects, and is thus suggested as a harm reduction strategy in response to these perceived health risks.",
            "In many countries where FGM/C is traditionally practiced, the prevalence rates of medicalization are increasing, and in countries of migration, such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America or Sweden, court cases or the repeated issuing of statements in favor of presumed minimal forms of FGM/C to replace more invasive forms, has raised the debate between the medical harm reduction arguments and the human rights approach.",
            "Main body: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the arguments associated with the medicalization of FGM/C, a trend that could undermine the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 5.3.",
            "The paper uses four country case studies, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya and UK, to discuss the reasons for engaging in medicalized forms of FGM/C, or not, and explores the ongoing public discourse in those countries concerning harm reduction versus human rights, and the contradiction between medical ethics, national criminal justice systems and international conventions.",
            "The discussion is structured around four key hotly contested ethical dilemmas.",
            "Firstly, that the WHO definition of medicalized FGM/C is too narrow allowing medicalized FGM to be justified by many healthcare professionals as a form of harm reduction which contradicts the medical oath of do no harm.",
            "Secondly, that medicalized FGM/C is a human rights abuse with lifelong consequences, no matter who performs it.",
            "Thirdly, that health care professionals who perform medicalized FGM/C are sustaining cultural norms that they themselves support and are also gaining financially.",
            "Fourthly, the contradiction between protecting traditional cultural rights in legal constitutions versus human rights legislation, which criminalizes FGM/C.",
            "Conclusion: More research needs to be done in order to understand the complexities that are facilitating the medicalization of FGM/C as well as how policy strategies can be strengthened to have a greater de-medicalization impact.",

            "In light of this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day on March 8, we want to draw attention to the risk of neglecting older women in the discourse on women\u2019s rights and in the recent campaigns around sexual victimisation.",
            "Sexual violence can induce long-lasting sexual, reproductive, physical, and mental health problems for victims and their peers, offspring, and community.",
            "In older adults, however, manifestations of these consequences are rarely recognised or linked to sexual victimisation.",
            "In contrast to the increasing research on elder abuse and neglect, sexual violence in older adults remains a largely under-researched area.",
            "In a meta-analysis of elder abuse prevalence in community settings, only 16 of 52 included studies addressed sexual violence.",
            "Moreover, reported prevalences of sexual violence in older adults were likely to be underestimated because of several methodological problems.",
            "First, most studies only included questions about rape, which is much less common than for example sexual harassment or sexual abuse without penetration.",
            "Second, in the majority of studies older adults were interviewed via telephone, which could lead to underreporting caused by safety issues, especially when victim and assailant live together.",
            "Third, all studies exclude cognitive impaired older adults who are known to be vulnerable to different types of abuse.",
            "And finally, all studies focus on assailants known to the victim, ignoring the fact that older adults can also be sexually offended by strangers.",
            "In summary, sexual violence in older adults is still too often conflated with other types of violence in the broader context of elder abuse and neglect.",
            "Although research shows that sexuality remains important in older age, older adults are frequently considered \u201casexual\u201d in policies and practices.",
            "This assumption of asexuality may further enhance the risk of ignoring that older women can be sexually victimised and in need of tailored care.",
            "Even the leading organisations providing guidance on care, including WHO, ignore the complexity of sexual violence in older adults by not including \u201cdisrespect of (sexual) intimacy\u201d and \u201csexual neglect\u201d into their definition of elder abuse and neglect.",
            "This exclusion might lead to inadequate care of older adult victims of sexual violence.",
            "Revising the definition of elder abuse and neglect by including \u201csexual neglect\u201d, as has recently been done by a group of academics and policy makers in Quebec, is of utmost importance.",
            "They defined \u201csexual neglect\u201d as \u201ca failure to provide privacy, failure to respect a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity, treating older adults as asexual beings and/or preventing them from expressing their sexuality, etc\u201d.",
            "Altough older women are faced with several challenges that are linked to biological ageing, including physical and cognitive impairement, we argue that they are not suddenly exempted from sexuality nor to being prone to sexual violence exposure.",
            "Older women should be considered as much female as women of other ages with specific vulnerabilities and risks of sexual victimisation.",
            "We urgently call for increased attention to older women in research, policies, and health practices."

            "Abstract",
            "Policy Points Current efforts to reduce infant mortality and improve infant health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can benefit from awareness of the history of successful early 20th-century initiatives to reduce infant mortality in high-income countries, which occurred before widespread use of vaccination and medical technologies.",
            "Improvements in sanitation, civil registration, milk purification, and institutional structures to monitor and reduce infant mortality played a crucial role in the decline in infant mortality seen in the United States in the early 1900s.",
            "The commitment to sanitation and civil registration has not been fulfilled in many LMICs.",
            "Structural investments in sanitation and water purification as well as in civil registration systems should be central, not peripheral, to the goal of infant mortality reduction in LMICs.",
            "Context: Between 1915 and 1950, the infant mortality rate (IMR) in the United States declined from 100 to fewer than 30 deaths per 1,000 live births, prior to the widespread use of medical technologies and vaccination.",
            "In 2015 the IMR in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was 53.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is comparable to the United States in 1935 when IMR was 55.7 deaths per 1,000 live births.",
            "We contrast the role of public health institutions and interventions for IMR reduction in past versus present efforts to reduce infant mortality in LMICs to critically examine the current evidence base for reducing infant mortality and to propose ways in which lessons from history can inform efforts to address the current burden of infant mortality.",
            "Methods: We searched the peer-reviewed and gray literature on the causes and explanations behind the decline in infant mortality in the United States between 1850 and 1950 and in LMICs after 2000.",
            "We included historical analyses, empirical research, policy documents, and global strategies.",
            "For each key source, we assessed the factors considered by their authors to be salient in reducing infant mortality.",
            "Findings: Public health programs that played a central role in the decline in infant mortality in the United States in the early 1900s emphasized large structural interventions like filtering and chlorinating water supplies, building sanitation systems, developing the birth and death registration area, pasteurizing milk, and also educating mothers on infant care and hygiene.",
            "The creation of new institutions and policies for infant health additionally provided technical expertise, mobilized resources, and engaged women's groups and public health professionals.",
            "In contrast, contemporary literature and global policy documents on reducing infant mortality in LMICs have primarily focused on interventions at the individual, household, and health facility level, and on the widespread adoption of cheap, ostensibly accessible, and simple technologies, often at the cost of leaving the structural conditions that determine child survival largely untouched.",
            "Conclusions: Current discourses on infant mortality are not informed by lessons from history.",
            "Although structural interventions were central to the decline in infant mortality in the United States, current interventions in LMICs that receive the most global endorsement do not address these structural determinants of infant mortality.",

            "Abstract",
            "Background: Perinatal mortality and morbidity continue to be major global health challenges strongly associated with prematurity and reduced fetal growth, an issue of further interest given the mounting evidence that fetal growth in general is linked to degrees of risk of common noncommunicable diseases in adulthood.",
            "Against this background, WHO made it a high priority to provide the present fetal growth charts for estimated fetal weight (EFW) and common ultrasound biometric measurements intended for worldwide use.",
            "Methods and findings: We conducted a multinational prospective observational longitudinal study of fetal growth in low-risk singleton pregnancies of women of high or middle socioeconomic status and without known environmental constraints on fetal growth.",
            "Centers in ten countries (Argentina, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Norway, and Thailand) recruited participants who had reliable information on last menstrual period and gestational age confirmed by crown-rump length measured at 8-13 wk of gestation.",
            "Participants had anthropometric and nutritional assessments and seven scheduled ultrasound examinations during pregnancy.",
            "Fifty-two participants withdrew consent, and 1,387 participated in the study.",
            "At study entry, median maternal age was 28 y (interquartile range [IQR] 25-31), median height was 162 cm (IQR 157-168), median weight was 61 kg (IQR 55-68), 58% of the women were nulliparous, and median daily caloric intake was 1,840 cal (IQR 1,487-2,222).",
            "The median pregnancy duration was 39 wk (IQR 38-40) although there were significant differences between countries, the largest difference being 12 d (95% CI 8-16).",
            "The median birthweight was 3,300 g (IQR 2,980-3,615).",
            "There were differences in birthweight between countries, e.g., India had significantly smaller neonates than the other countries, even after adjusting for gestational age.",
            "Thirty-one women had a miscarriage, and three fetuses had intrauterine death.",
            "The 8,203 sets of ultrasound measurements were scrutinized for outliers and leverage points, and those measurements taken at 14 to 40 wk were selected for analysis.",
            "A total of 7,924 sets of ultrasound measurements were analyzed by quantile regression to establish longitudinal reference intervals for fetal head circumference, biparietal diameter, humerus length, abdominal circumference, femur length and its ratio with head circumference and with biparietal diameter, and EFW.",
            "There was asymmetric distribution of growth of EFW: a slightly wider distribution among the lower percentiles during early weeks shifted to a notably expanded distribution of the higher percentiles in late pregnancy.",
            "Male fetuses were larger than female fetuses as measured by EFW, but the disparity was smaller in the lower quantiles of the distribution (3.5%) and larger in the upper quantiles (4.5%).",
            "Maternal age and maternal height were associated with a positive effect on EFW, particularly in the lower tail of the distribution, of the order of 2% to 3% for each additional 10 y of age of the mother and 1% to 2% for each additional 10 cm of height.",
            "Maternal weight was associated with a small positive effect on EFW, especially in the higher tail of the distribution, of the order of 1.0% to 1.5% for each additional 10 kg of bodyweight of the mother.",
            "Parous women had heavier fetuses than nulliparous women, with the disparity being greater in the lower quantiles of the distribution, of the order of 1% to 1.5%, and diminishing in the upper quantiles.",
            "There were also significant differences in growth of EFW between countries.",
            "In spite of the multinational nature of the study, sample size is a limiting factor for generalization of the charts.",
            "Conclusions: This study provides WHO fetal growth charts for EFW and common ultrasound biometric measurements, and shows variation between different parts of the world."

            "Second, the article makes a case for being critically skeptical of specific deployments of the concept of health when it has been moralized in this way.",
            "In such cases, what typically results is that some other personal value/norm, or set of values/norms, held by the individual is treated as intrinsically at odds with the concept of health, which is presumed, uncritically, to be superior, often because it is taken to be free-standing and self-justifying.",

            "This rate is two times higher than most other European Union countries.",
            "Materials and methods:                    The research is based on a secondary analysis of data contained in multiple Polish governmental reports, including those of the Prevention and Analysis Office of Road Traffic Headquarters of Police, National Road Safety Program-GAMBIT 2005, National Road Safety Program 2013 to 2020, and Strategy for Efficient State in 2020, plus previous publications describing road safety in Poland.",

            "Background: It has been hypothesized that prisons serve as amplifiers of general tuberculosis (TB) epidemics, but there is a paucity of data on this phenomenon and the potential population-level effects of prison-focused interventions.",
            "This study (1) quantifies the TB risk for prisoners as they traverse incarceration and release, (2) mathematically models the impact of prison-based interventions on TB burden in the general population, and (3) generalizes this model to a wide range of epidemiological contexts.",
            "Methods and findings: We obtained individual-level incarceration data for all inmates (n = 42,925) and all reported TB cases (n = 5,643) in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul from 2007 through 2013.",
            "We matched individuals between prisoner and TB databases and estimated the incidence of TB from the time of incarceration and the time of prison release using Cox proportional hazards models.",
            "We identified 130 new TB cases diagnosed during incarceration and 170 among individuals released from prison.",
            "During imprisonment, TB rates increased from 111 cases per 100,000 person-years at entry to a maximum of 1,303 per 100,000 person-years at 5.2 years.",
            "At release, TB incidence was 229 per 100,000 person-years, which declined to 42 per 100,000 person-years (the average TB incidence in Brazil) after 7 years.",

            "Annual mass TB screening within Brazilian prisons would reduce TB incidence in prisons by 47.4% (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI], 44.4%-52.5%) and in the general population by 19.4% (95% BCI 17.9%-24.2%).",

            "Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prison environment, more so than the prison population itself, drives TB incidence, and targeted interventions within prisons could have a substantial effect on the broader TB epidemic."

            "To bridge the gap in scientific knowledge and add evidence to the ongoing studies in other Asian cities, a retrospective time-series study on air pollution and mortality in Delhi was initiated under the HEI Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA) program.",

            "Results and implications:                    The study findings showed that increased concentrations of PM with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microg/m3 (PM10) and of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were associated with increased all-natural-cause mortality.",
            "It was found that every 10-microg/m3 change in PM10 was associated with only a 0.15% increase in total all-natural-cause mortality.",

            "Abstract",
            "On account of the continuously increasing electricity consumption and concern for environmental issues, renewable energy sources have been widely utilized to generate electricity, and they present advantages such as cleanness, easy availability, low cost, and abundance.",
            "In 2017, the installed capacity of solar and wind power worldwide amounted to 903.1\u202fGW, which represented 41.4% of the total installed capacity of renewable energy.",
            "Hybrid renewable energy systems have been proposed to overcome the variability and randomness of a single renewable energy source such as solar and wind power, and more than 80% of them are off-grid systems.",
            "Meanwhile, it is necessary to determine the size of each component to design a reliable and cost-effective hybrid renewable energy system.",
            "Therefore, this paper mainly reviews the recent classification, evaluation indicators, and sizing methodologies of hybrid renewable energy systems (stand-alone and grid-connected).",
            "Further optimization research is still required to improve the overall performance of hybrid renewable energy systems.",
            "Decision makers can explore and develop hybrid systems including hydropower and/or pumped hydro storage based on their superiority, and they should also pay attention to the development of hybrid energy storage.",
            "In addition to reliability and economic indicators, which have applications above 80%, more attention should be payed to environmental and social indicators to determine the system capacity, and some new indicators should be disseminated.",
            "The features of traditional, artificial intelligence, and hybrid methods, in additional to software tools, were assessed.",
            "Moreover, hybrid methods with high accuracy and fast convergence that can surmount the defects of single methods are the most promising sizing method compared to the other three sizing methods.",

            "This paper uses Hainan Province of China as a case study to examine the present situation, predicaments, and future changes of the country's SSFs during a process of transition from extensive to green development.",
            "In doing so, we follow the social-ecological system (SES) framework to present Hainan's SSF-related settings, and study its resource systems, governance systems and actors through reviewing national and local policies, surveying and interviewing SSF stakeholders.",
            "Marine fisheries in Hainan is SSF-dominated, experienced dramatic increase in terms of yield and jobs since 1978, and became the main source of most fishermen's livelihood.",
            "Fish community structure and fishing targets have shifted from a mix of large-bodied demersals and pelagics to smaller-bodied pelagics with high growth rates and fecundity levels.",
            "This degradation puts stress on China's central and local governments to enhance the preservation of marine ecosystems.",
            "Effort controls failed to reduce fishing power due to subsidies, a series of measures were introduced in 2015 to correct these problems, including obligatory targets with accountability, subsidy reductions, buyback program, and further reductions of fishing vessels and allowable catch implemented in 2017.",
            "Hainan has explored different development directions for SSFs.",
            "First, providing policies and funds to reduce small fishing boats and construct larger vessels to support offshore and distant-water fisheries.",
            "Second, enhancing fishery value by integrating the development of fishery-related primary, secondary, and tertiary industries.",
            "Third, developing existing SSFs in a sustainable manner through standardizing SSF vessel types, delineating operating areas, developing fishing port economy, and building beautiful fishing villages.",
            "These practices illustrate that China's centralized government can likely command transformational changes in ecological and socio-economic outcomes according to policy objectives.",
            "Also, a broadened perspective that considers the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of SSFs as whole is also crucial.",
            "Moreover, the integration of fishery policies with other related socioeconomic policies, and the interdepartmental cooperation is needed to achieve policy consistency across local governments."

            "In 2007, the Indonesian Government instigated a national program to convert domestic kerosene users to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking.",
            "This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies.",
            "Objective",
            "To review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP).",
            "Methods and data sources",
            "Searches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys.",
            "The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach.",
            "Results",
            "The main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia.",
            "Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used.",
            "Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015.",
            "Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households.",
            "While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited.",

            "We tested 4 main predictions, derived from life history theory and self-evident human diurnality, regarding maternal sleep behaviors in a non-industrialized population in which mother-nursling co-sleeping is universal and prolonged: (1) Night breastfeeding incurs a sleep cost to co-sleeping mothers; (2) Night breastfeeding increases with infant age, causing mothers to sleep less; (3) Sleep duration co-varies with darkness duration; (4) Access to electricity reduces sleep duration.",

            "Australia's coastal cities and towns, with over 85 per cent of the nation's population, are at the frontline of physical risks associated with sea level rise and changed weather patterns; exacerbated by ongoing concentration of public and private assets in potentially vulnerable locations.",
            "This is particularly so for coastal councils beyond the major capital cities, where settlement patterns and lifestyle oriented economies based on tourism and leisure focus on the coastal strip, and local government resources are highly constrained.",
            "To assess progress in climate change adaptation planning, this study involved local government professionals, experts and elected officials through a survey and focus groups (n = 49) held between February and July 2011.",
            "The audit indicates some areas are well underway towards holistic adaptation strategies but, others have neither engaged, nor anticipate, adaptation planning activities; of the strategies that have commenced, few are yet completed; and, despite ongoing development pressure, few councils have yet changed their planning controls for climate risk.",
            "Of those areas that have commenced adaptation planning, most strategies and commitments will require additional resourcing and external expertise to implement; while others face community skepticism and \u201cpushback\u201d which may undermine future progress.",
            "The results reveal a ladder of adaptation action, whereby communities tend to have to accomplish early steps before they move on to more complex, expensive, or political policies.",
            "We connect this ladder to community perceptions of what is supported in state and national frameworks and legislation.",
            "Communities in the future may be able to use this ladder to suggest where to start their processes, and directions to undertake as they accomplish their first tasks."

            "Previous studies of climate change impact on hydrology have focused on the direct impact and little has been reported in the literature on catchment-scale the indirect impact.",
            "In this study, we calibrated an ecohydrological model (WAVES) and used this model to estimate the direct and indirect effects and the interactive effect between climate change and eCO2 on water availability in four different catchments in Australia with contrasting climate regime and vegetation cover.",
            "These catchments were: a water-limited forest catchment and an energy-limited forest catchment, a water-limited grass catchment and an energy-limited grass catchment.",
            "The future meteorological forcing was projected from 12 GCMs representing a period centred on 2050s and future CO2 concentration was set as 550ppm.",
            "Modelling experiments show that impacts of eCO2 and projected climate change on vegetation growth, evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff were in the same magnitude but opposite directions in all four catchments, except for the effects on runoff in the energy-limited grass catchment.",
            "Predicted responses of runoff to eCO2 indicate that eCO2 increased runoff in the energy-limited forest catchment by \u223c2% but decreased runoff in other three catchments from 1% to 18%.",
            "This study indicates that rising CO2 increases ecosystem water use efficiency but it does not necessarily result in increased runoff because elevated CO2 also stimulates vegetation growth and increases ET.",
            "Elevated CO2 was proved to have greater impacts on runoff than climate change in the forest catchments.",
            "Modelling experiments also suggest that interactive effects between climate and CO2 are important, especially for predicting leaf area index (LAI) and ET in grassland catchments or runoff in water-limited catchments, where interactive effects were 1\u20136%.",

            "This study highlights the importance of considering elevated CO2 in assessing climate change impacts on catchment-scale water balance and failure to account for direct eCO2 effect or its interactive effects can lead to large bias in the predictions of future water budgets, especially for the water-limited catchments in Australia."
