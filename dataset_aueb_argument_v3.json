The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process.

At the time of clinically evident arthritis and diagnosis, the disease is already persisting, requiring long-term suppressive treatment. My overarching aim is to prevent chronic arthritis and RA by inhibiting the evolving auto-immune response in a pre-arthritis phase. Currently, identification of RA-patients before the classic presentation with clinically evident chronic arthritis is beyond the state of the art. I here aim to achieve this early recognition by increasing the mechanistic understanding of pre-arthritis phases.<br/> <br/>I intend to study RA-specific auto-immune responses at the cellular and humoral level as well as markers reflecting local and systemic inflammation. These aspects are selected based on my world-wide validated rule to predict RA-development in early arthritis and on recent work on progression from Clinically Suspect Arthralgia (CSA) to clinical arthritis.<br/><br/>This project is now finally feasible, thanks to unique \u2018pre-RA\u2019 cohorts and cross-boundary preparatory work done with basic scientists, clinicians and engineers. My research concept is to integrate the products of separate trajectories in a longitudinal study and translate it to the clinic. <br/><br/>Patients with CSA will be studied serially in time. Using validated methods and novel techniques and insights we will: delineate molecular and predictive features of RA-specific auto-antibodies and auto-antibody secreting B-cells, identify improved markers of systemic inflammation and test and validate a computer-aided image analysis system to detect subclinical joint inflammation on MRI. Serial data will be combined to reveal interactions between markers and time relationships. Lastly a prediction model identifying imminent RA will be developed. The forefront position of my group allows national and international validation. <br/><br/>Together, this multidisciplinary and intersectorial project will open new horizons for preventive, targeted interventions.",

    "project_objective": "We outline a 5 year programme that introduces a new platform for the preparation, understanding, and exploitation of precisely defined nano-molecules / materials based upon the assembly of molecular metal oxide precursors (polyoxometalates) under non-equilibrium conditions with well-defined physical properties using automated intelligent feedback. We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

In order to secure a widespread application of these reactions in organic synthesis and in order to make the respective products available for high-tech applications, it is required that photochemical reactions can be performed enantioselectively, i.e. that the three-dimensional architecture of the product molecules is unambiguously defined. Despite some progress in recent years, this challenge has as yet remained unsolved. It is the objective of this proposal to develop catalytic methods that allow the enantioselective synthesis of a broad variety of compound classes by light-induced reactions. The mode of action of potential catalysts is based on energy transfer or on wavelength-selective excitation. In the former scenario, the substrate-catalyst complex will be held together by non-covalent interactions, which position the substrate for an efficient energy transfer and for an enantioselective approach of the reagent. In the latter approach, acid-base interactions in the substrate-catalyst complex will lead to a significant bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate, enabling a selective excitation within the complex and a subsequent enantioselective reaction pathway within a spatially defined chiral environment. Both approaches include the option to employ sunlight as the exclusive energy source to drive enantioselective processes without the need to apply external heat or pressure.",

    "project_objective": "Applied electrochemistry plays a key role in many technologies, such as batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors or solar cells. It is therefore at the core of many research programs all over the world. Yet, fundamental electrochemical investigations remain scarce. In particular, electrochemistry is among the fields for which the gap between theory and experiment is the largest. From the computational point of view, there is no molecular dynamics (MD) software devoted to the simulation of electrochemical systems while other fields such as biochemistry (GROMACS) or material science (LAMMPS) have dedicated tools. This is due to the difficulty of accounting for complex effects arising from (i) the degree of metallicity of the electrode (i.e. from semimetals to perfect conductors), (ii) the mutual polarization occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface and (iii) the redox reactivity through explicit electron transfers. Current understanding therefore relies on standard theories that derive from an inaccurate molecular-scale picture. My objective is to fill this gap by introducing a whole set of new methods for simulating electrochemical systems. They will be provided to the computational electrochemistry community as a cutting-edge MD software adapted to supercomputers. First applications will aim at the discovery of new electrolytes for energy storage. Here I will focus on (1) \u2018\u2018water-in-salts\u2019\u2019 to understand why these revolutionary liquids enable much higher voltage than conventional solutions (2) redox reactions inside a nanoporous electrode to support the development of future capacitive energy storage devices. These selected applications are timely and rely on collaborations with leading experimental partners. The results are expected to shed an unprecedented light on the importance of polarization effects on the structure and the reactivity of electrode/electrolyte interfaces, establishing MD as a prominent tool for solving complex electrochemistry problems.",

Three related user communities lie at the heart of the CoE: academic, industrial and clinical researchers who all wish to build, develop and extend such capabilities in line with the increasing power of high performance computers. Three distinct exemplar research areas will be pursued: cardiovascular, molecularly-based and neuro-musculoskeletal medicine.<br/> <br/>Predictive computational biomedicine involves applications that are comprised of multiple components, arranged as far as possible into automated workflows in which data is taken, from an individual patient, processed, and combined into a model which produces predicted health outcomes. Many of the models are multiscale, requiring the coupling of two or more high performance codes. Computational biomedicine holds out the prospect of predicting the effect of personalised medical treatments and interventions ahead of carrying them out, with all the ensuing benefits. Indeed, in some cases, it is already doing so today.<br/> <br/>The CoE presents a powerful consortium of partners and has an outward facing nature and will actively train, disseminate and engage with these user communities across Europe and beyond. Because this field is new and growing rapidly, it offers numerous innovative opportunities. There are three SMEs and three enterprises within the project, as well as eight associate partners drawn from across the biomedical sector, who are fully aware of the vast potential of HPC in this domain. We shall work with them to advance the exploitation of HPC and will engage closely with medical professionals through our partner hospitals in order to establish modeling and simulation as an integral part of clinical decision making. Our CoE is thus user-driven, integrated, multidisciplinary, and distributed; presenting a vision that is in line with the Work Programme.",

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

A major challenge for climate change science is to develop an understanding of the sensitivity of organisms to the changing environment, and try and find spatial, broad taxonomic or trait based generalities that will enable more accurate identification of regions and ecosystems at severe risk of climate change impacts (sensitivity hotspots) so that mitigation and adaptive management actions can be prioritised. There are, however, several challenges associated with predicting sensitivity hotspots. At the forefront of these challenges is our understanding of the drivers of organism\u2019s thermal tolerance thresholds, and the proximity of temperature thresholds to the local climate extremes and climate change projections, herein called thermal safety margin (TSM). This project merges concepts from physiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, biogeography and physical oceanography into an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that exposes inconsistencies among current paradigms and fundamental limitations to our understanding of the sensitivity of marine organisms to climate change. The conceptual framework presented here offers a testable, interdisciplinary model to address this knowledge gap. Specifically we ask the questions 1) How do patterns in thermal tolerance breadth and thermal safety margins vary throughout species\u2019 geographical ranges? And 2) What are the environmental drivers, biotic traits and evolutionary factors that determine an organisms thermal tolerance? Through identifying the nature of thermal tolerance patterns and identifying some of the mechanisms influencing these patterns, this research aims to increase the accuracy and resolution of predictions of the sensitivity of marine biota to climate change.",

ZIKAlliance will addrees three key objectives relating to (i) impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy and short & medium term effects on newborns, (ii) associated natural history of ZIKV infection in humans and their environment in the context of other circulating arboviruses and (iii) building the overall capacity for preparedness research for future epidemic threats in Latin America & the Caribbean. The project will take advantage of large standardised clinical cohorts of pregnant women and febrile patients in regions of Latin America and the Caribbean were the virus is circulating, expanding a preexisting network established by the IDAMS EU project. I will also benefit of a very strong expertise in basic and environmental sciences, with access to both field work and sophisticated technological infrastructures to characterise virus replication and physiopathology mechanisms. To meet its 3 key objectives, the scientific project has been organised in 9 work packages, with WP2/3 dedicated to clinical research (cohorts, clinical biology, epidemiology & modeling), WP3/4 to basic research (virology & antivirals, pathophysiology & animal models), WP5/6 to environmental research (animal reservoirs, vectors & vector control) , WP7/8 to social sciences & communication, and WP9 to management. The broad consortium set-up allow gathering the necessary expertise for an actual interdisciplinary approach, and operating in a range of countries with contrasting ZIKV epidemiological status.\"",

As adherent cells also read their environment through substrate interactions there is a great interest in developing such substrates in a predictable manner. Their first point of contact is through their focal adhesions and it is also though them that forces are applied allowing the cell to migrate and establish cytoskeletal tension which in turn regulates cell function. The objective of this project is to investigate the cell-substrate interaction at the nanoscale and correlate that to the surface topography for predictable biomaterials. Through the application of state-of-the-art nanofabrication we will fabricate precise surface topographies with length scales comparable to the structural units found in the focal adhesions. The aim is to map and understand the topographical influence in the architectural arrangement of the proteins in the adhesions. Aided by high resolution microscopy we will classify cell types on different nanotopographies. Combining that information with machine learning, we will be able to gain information about cell characteristics from the rule set. That information can also be used in reverse to identify cell types with the previously defined characteristic. This approach is similar to face recognition seen on cameras and mobile phones.<br/> <br/>The proposed research project will not only provide insight to an area of biomaterials not previously explored, yet aim to provide a blueprint for future design of biomaterials.",

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

Understanding such variations requires insights from the past. However, no data sets of past climate are available to study decadal variability of large-scale climate with state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Currently available data sets are limited to statistical reconstructions of local or regional surface climate. The PALAEO-RA project will produce the first ever comprehensive, 3-dimensional, physically consistent reconstruction of the global climate system at a monthly scale for the past six centuries. This palaeoreanalysis is based on combining information from early instrumental measurements, historical documents (e.g. capitalizing on large amounts of newly available data from China), and proxies (e.g. tree rings) with a large ensemble of climate model simulations. To achieve this novel combination, a completely new data assimilation system for palaeoclimatological data will be developed. The unique data sets produced in this project will become reference data sets for studying past climatic variations (i) for diagnostic studies of interannual-to-decadal variability, (ii) as a benchmark for model simulations and (iii) for climate impact studies. Using the data produced, the project will analyse episodes of slowed or accelerated global warming, decadal subtropical drought periods, episodes of expanding or contracting tropics, slowed or strengthened monsoons, changes in storm tracks, blocking and associated weather extremes, and links between Arctic and midlatitude climate. The analyses will provide new insights into the processes governing decadal variability of weather and climate.",

So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction \u2013 which will be studied numerically and experimentally \u2013 the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale.

    "project_objective": "Animals harbor specialized bacterial communities in their guts, typically referred to as gut microbiomes. Despite the importance of gut microbiomes for host health, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. There is evidence that the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome has emerged through the diversification of a few founder lineages. However, how lineages have diversified into discrete species and which underlying mechanisms maintain the diversity in the gut remains elusive. The current project will address these questions by studying the gut microbiome of honey bees. We have recently found that the eight dominant bacterial lineages in the honey bee gut have substantially diversified, which is a striking parallelism to the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome. Moreover, we have established experiments to colonize microbiota-free bees with cultured isolates of divergent bee gut bacteria. This provides us with unique opportunities to study bacterial evolution in the gut in a simple and experimentally amenable system. The project is divided into four work packages addressing interconnected research questions of current biology: We will (i) determine the population genomic landscape of divergent gut bacteria, (ii) investigate whether bacterial diversification has resulted in competition or cooperation, (iii) discover novel mechanisms of bacterial interactions, and (iv) reveal how bacterial diversification impacts the symbiosis with the host. To this end, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining comparative metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, bee colonization experiments, microscopy, bacterial genetics, and automated bee tracking. This project situated at the forefront of microbial symbiosis will provide groundbreaking insights into microbial evolution and ecology, gut microbiology, and honey bee health and biology.",

At the time of clinically evident arthritis and diagnosis, the disease is already persisting, requiring long-term suppressive treatment. My overarching aim is to prevent chronic arthritis and RA by inhibiting the evolving auto-immune response in a pre-arthritis phase. Currently, identification of RA-patients before the classic presentation with clinically evident chronic arthritis is beyond the state of the art. I here aim to achieve this early recognition by increasing the mechanistic understanding of pre-arthritis phases.<br/> <br/>I intend to study RA-specific auto-immune responses at the cellular and humoral level as well as markers reflecting local and systemic inflammation. These aspects are selected based on my world-wide validated rule to predict RA-development in early arthritis and on recent work on progression from Clinically Suspect Arthralgia (CSA) to clinical arthritis.<br/><br/>This project is now finally feasible, thanks to unique \u2018pre-RA\u2019 cohorts and cross-boundary preparatory work done with basic scientists, clinicians and engineers. My research concept is to integrate the products of separate trajectories in a longitudinal study and translate it to the clinic. <br/><br/>Patients with CSA will be studied serially in time. Using validated methods and novel techniques and insights we will: delineate molecular and predictive features of RA-specific auto-antibodies and auto-antibody secreting B-cells, identify improved markers of systemic inflammation and test and validate a computer-aided image analysis system to detect subclinical joint inflammation on MRI. Serial data will be combined to reveal interactions between markers and time relationships. Lastly a prediction model identifying imminent RA will be developed. The forefront position of my group allows national and international validation. <br/><br/>Together, this multidisciplinary and intersectorial project will open new horizons for preventive, targeted interventions.",

      "This initiative aims to build first-of-its-kind ensemble climate experiments of convection permitting models to investigate present and future convective processes and related extremes over Europe and the Mediterranean.",
      "In this manuscript the rationale, scientific aims and approaches are presented along with some preliminary results from the testing phase of the project.",
      "Three test cases were selected in order to obtain a first look at the ensemble performance.",
      "The test cases covered a summertime extreme precipitation event over Austria, a fall Foehn event over the Swiss Alps and an intensively documented fall event along the Mediterranean coast.",
      "The test cases were run in both \u201cweather-like\u201d (WL, initialized just before the event in question) and \u201cclimate\u201d (CM, initialized 1 month before the event) modes.",
      "Ensembles of 18\u201321 members, representing six different modeling systems with different physics and modelling chain options, was generated for the test cases (27 modeling teams have committed to perform the longer climate simulations).",
      "Results indicate that, when run in WL mode, the ensemble captures all three events quite well with ensemble correlation skill scores of 0.67, 0.82 and 0.91.",
      "They suggest that the more the event is driven by large-scale conditions, the closer the agreement between the ensemble members.",
      "Even in climate mode the large-scale driven events over the Swiss Alps and the Mediterranean coasts are still captured (ensemble correlation skill scores of 0.90 and 0.62, respectively), but the inter-model spread increases as expected.",
      "In the case over Mediterranean the effects of local-scale interactions between flow and orography and land\u2013ocean contrasts are readily apparent.",
      "However, there is a much larger, though not surprising, increase in the spread for the Austrian event, which was weakly forced by the large-scale flow.",
      "Though the ensemble correlation skill score is still quite high (0.80).",
      "The preliminary results illustrate both the promise and the challenges that convection permitting modeling faces and make a strong argument for an ensemble-based approach to investigating high impact convective processes."

Sector-specific end-users in policy and business will be identified and engaged individually, with iterative feedback, to ensure that new climate information is tailored, actionable and strengthening societal risk management decisions.<br/>These goals will be achieved through the development of coupled GCMs from seven groups across Europe, with sufficient resolution to reproduce realistic weather and climate features (~25km mesh size), in addition to enhanced process parameterisation. Thorough assessment will use innovative process-based metrics and the latest observational and reanalysis datasets. Targeted experimental design will reduce inter-model spread and produce robust projections, forming the European contribution to the CMIP6 High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, led by PRIMAVERA. <br/>It is the first time that high-resolution coupled GCMs will be used under a single experimental protocol. Coordination, and the underlying process-understanding, will significantly increase the robustness of our findings. Our new capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the drivers of variability and change in European climate, including extremes, since such regional changes continue to be characterised by high uncertainty. <br/>We will also explore the frontiers of climate modelling and of high performance computing to produce simulations with a reduced reliance on physical parameterisations.

      "This study undertakes a multi-model comparison with the aim to describe and quantify systematic changes of the global energy and water budgets when the horizontal resolution of atmospheric models is increased and to identify common factors of these changes among models.",
      "To do so, we analyse an ensemble of twelve atmosphere-only and six coupled GCMs, with different model formulations and with resolutions spanning those of state-of-the-art coupled GCMs, i.e. from resolutions coarser than 100\u00a0km to resolutions finer than 25\u00a0km.",
      "The main changes in the global energy budget with resolution are a systematic increase in outgoing longwave radiation and decrease in outgoing shortwave radiation due to changes in cloud properties, and a systematic increase in surface latent heat flux; when resolution is increased from 100 to 25\u00a0km, the magnitude of the change of those fluxes can be as large as 5\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22122.",
      "Moreover, all but one atmosphere-only model simulate a decrease of the poleward energy transport at higher resolution, mainly explained by a reduction of the equator-to-pole tropospheric temperature gradient.",
      "Regarding hydrological processes, our results are the following: (1) there is an increase of global precipitation with increasing resolution in all models (up to 40\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 km3\u00a0year\u22121) but the partitioning between land and ocean varies among models; (2) the fraction of total precipitation that falls on land is on average 10% larger at higher resolution in grid point models, but it is smaller\u00a0at higher resolution in spectral models; (3) grid points models simulate an increase of the fraction of land precipitation due to moisture convergence twice as large as in spectral models; (4) grid point models, which have a better resolved orography, show an increase of orographic precipitation of up to 13\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 km3\u00a0year\u22121 which explains most of the change in land precipitation; (5) at the regional scale, precipitation pattern and amplitude are improved with increased resolution due to a better simulated seasonal mean circulation.",

    "project_objective": "There is rising concern that several subsystems of the Earth may respond highly nonlinearly at critical future levels of anthropogenic forcing; these levels have recently been associated with tipping points (TPs). It is paramount to identify safe operating spaces for humanity and the planet in terms of these critical forcing levels, in order to prevent harmful transitions to alternative, undesirable states of the Earth system. The mechanisms leading to such abrupt transitions are only partly understood, and further research in this regard is urgently needed. State-of-art Earth System Models appear to respond too smoothly at TPs and have difficulties in simulating abrupt transitions that occurred in the planet\u2019s history.   TiPES will address these problems from several angles: 1. The project will identify subsystems that may exhibit abrupt transitions, and couplings between them, by focussing on paleoclimatic records and abrupt transitions therein. Novel methods to detect Early Warning Signals of forthcoming TPs, and to make skilful predictions on their basis, will be developed. 2. The potential shortcomings of models in representing TPs will be evaluated; in particular, TiPES will investigate how Bayesian calibration techniques can help enable these models to simulate past abrupt transitions.  3. TiPES will develop a generalized theory of climate sensitivity that accounts for the presence of TPs and feedbacks across various time scales.  4. To define safe operating spaces. TiPES will focus on dynamical system theory and on global stability notions for non-autonomous systems in order to estimate the stability of desirable states.  5. The results obtained by the project will be communicated to policy makers in a manner that facilitates decisions and their implementation. TiPES will develop formal approaches to define the socioeconomic risks of crossing TPs, and to derive decision strategies to keep anthropogenic forcing below levels where abrupt transitions may occur.",

A fourth identified knowledge gap is the effective translation of new physical science understanding into an improved evidence base for policy decisions. CONSTRAIN will address this by developing climate model emulators that integrate and operationalise learning from across the consortium to provide new capability to assess impacts of climate change under a broad range of emission scenarios.

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

      "In addition, perturbation of SLC transporter function underlies numerous human diseases, which renders SLC transporters attractive drug targets.",
      "Common genetic polymorphisms in SLC genes have been associated with inter-individual differences in drug efficacy and toxicity.",
      "However, despite their tremendous clinical relevance, epidemiological data of these variants are mostly derived from heterogeneous cohorts of small sample size and the genetic SLC landscape beyond these common variants has not been comprehensively assessed.",
      "In this study, we analyzed Next-Generation Sequencing data from 141,456 individuals from seven major human populations to evaluate genetic variability, its functional consequences, and ethnogeographic patterns across the entire SLC superfamily of transporters.",
      "Importantly, of the 204,287 exonic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) which we identified, 99.8% were present in less than 1% of analyzed alleles.",
      "Comprehensive computational analyses using 13 partially orthogonal algorithms that predict the functional impact of genetic variations based on sequence information, evolutionary conservation, structural considerations, and functional genomics data revealed that each individual genome harbors 29.7 variants with putative\u00a0functional effects, of which rare variants account for 18%.",
      "Inter-ethnic variability was found to be extensive, and 83% of deleterious SLC variants were only identified in a single population.",
      "Interestingly, population-specific carrier frequencies of loss-of-function variants in SLC genes associated with recessive Mendelian disease recapitulated the ethnogeographic variation of the corresponding disorders, including cystinuria in Jewish individuals, type II citrullinemia in East Asians, and lysinuric protein intolerance in Finns, thus providing a powerful resource for clinical geneticists to inform about population-specific prevalence and allelic composition of Mendelian SLC diseases.",
      "In summary, we present the most comprehensive data set of SLC variability published to date, which can provide insights into inter-individual differences in SLC transporter function and guide the optimization of population-specific genotyping strategies in the bourgeoning fields of personalized medicine and precision public health."

The IHM comprises several core cardiac models \u2013 electrophysiology, solid and fluid mechanics, microscopic cellular force generation, and valve dynamics \u2013 which are then coupled and finally embedded into the systemic and pulmonary blood circulations. It is a multiscale system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) featuring multiphysics interactions among the core models.<br/><br/>The physical and mathematical properties of each core model and those of the even more complex integrated heart model (IHM) will be analyzed. The numerical approximation of IHM develops along several steps: introduce new high order methods for the core models, carry out their stability and convergence analysis, devise new paradigms for their numerical coupling, and construct optimal, scalable, and adaptive preconditioners for the efficient solution of the resulting large-scale discrete problems. To address data variability in clinically relevant cases, new reduced order models and efficient computational techniques will be developed also for forward and inverse uncertainty quantification problems. Two software libraries, LifeHEART and RedHEART, will be built and made available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>The project is original, very ambitious, mathematically inspired and rigorous, tremendously challenging, and groundbreaking. If successful, it will provide researchers from applied mathematics and life sciences, cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons with a powerful tool for both the qualitative and quantitative study of cardiac function and dysfunction. iHEART has the potential to drive improvements in diagnosis and treatment for cardiovascular pathologies that are responsible for more than 45% of deaths in Europe.",

    "project_objective": "There is rising concern that several subsystems of the Earth may respond highly nonlinearly at critical future levels of anthropogenic forcing; these levels have recently been associated with tipping points (TPs). It is paramount to identify safe operating spaces for humanity and the planet in terms of these critical forcing levels, in order to prevent harmful transitions to alternative, undesirable states of the Earth system. The mechanisms leading to such abrupt transitions are only partly understood, and further research in this regard is urgently needed. State-of-art Earth System Models appear to respond too smoothly at TPs and have difficulties in simulating abrupt transitions that occurred in the planet\u2019s history.   TiPES will address these problems from several angles: 1. The project will identify subsystems that may exhibit abrupt transitions, and couplings between them, by focussing on paleoclimatic records and abrupt transitions therein. Novel methods to detect Early Warning Signals of forthcoming TPs, and to make skilful predictions on their basis, will be developed. 2. The potential shortcomings of models in representing TPs will be evaluated; in particular, TiPES will investigate how Bayesian calibration techniques can help enable these models to simulate past abrupt transitions.  3. TiPES will develop a generalized theory of climate sensitivity that accounts for the presence of TPs and feedbacks across various time scales.  4. To define safe operating spaces. TiPES will focus on dynamical system theory and on global stability notions for non-autonomous systems in order to estimate the stability of desirable states.  5. The results obtained by the project will be communicated to policy makers in a manner that facilitates decisions and their implementation. TiPES will develop formal approaches to define the socioeconomic risks of crossing TPs, and to derive decision strategies to keep anthropogenic forcing below levels where abrupt transitions may occur.",

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

    "project_objective": "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease in the aging population of Europe. NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

Three related user communities lie at the heart of the CoE: academic, industrial and clinical researchers who all wish to build, develop and extend such capabilities in line with the increasing power of high performance computers. Three distinct exemplar research areas will be pursued: cardiovascular, molecularly-based and neuro-musculoskeletal medicine.<br/> <br/>Predictive computational biomedicine involves applications that are comprised of multiple components, arranged as far as possible into automated workflows in which data is taken, from an individual patient, processed, and combined into a model which produces predicted health outcomes. Many of the models are multiscale, requiring the coupling of two or more high performance codes. Computational biomedicine holds out the prospect of predicting the effect of personalised medical treatments and interventions ahead of carrying them out, with all the ensuing benefits. Indeed, in some cases, it is already doing so today.<br/> <br/>The CoE presents a powerful consortium of partners and has an outward facing nature and will actively train, disseminate and engage with these user communities across Europe and beyond. Because this field is new and growing rapidly, it offers numerous innovative opportunities. There are three SMEs and three enterprises within the project, as well as eight associate partners drawn from across the biomedical sector, who are fully aware of the vast potential of HPC in this domain. We shall work with them to advance the exploitation of HPC and will engage closely with medical professionals through our partner hospitals in order to establish modeling and simulation as an integral part of clinical decision making. Our CoE is thus user-driven, integrated, multidisciplinary, and distributed; presenting a vision that is in line with the Work Programme.",

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

    "project_objective": "The recent IPCC report identifies mineral dust and the associated uncertainties in climate projections as key topics for future research. Dust size distribution in climate models controls the dust-radiation-cloud interactions and is a major contributor to these uncertainties. Observations show that the coarse mode of dust can be sustained during long-range transport, while current understanding fails in explaining why the lifetime of large airborne dust particles is longer than expected from gravitational settling theories. This discrepancy between observations and theory suggests that other processes counterbalance the effect of gravity along transport. D-TECT envisages filling this knowledge gap by studying the contribution of the triboelectrification (contact electrification) on particle removal processes. Our hypothesis is that triboelectric charging generates adequate electric fields to hold large dust particles up in the atmosphere. D-TECT aims to (i) parameterize the physical mechanisms responsible for dust triboelectrification; (ii) assess the impact of electrification on dust settling; (iii) quantify the climatic impacts of the process, particularly the effect on the dust size evolution during transport, on dry deposition and on CCN/IN reservoirs, and the effect of the electric field on particle orientation and on radiative transfer. The approach involves the development of a novel specialized high-power lidar system to detect and characterize aerosol particle orientation and a large-scale field experiment in the Mediterranean Basin using unprecedented ground-based remote sensing and airborne in-situ observation synergies. Considering aerosol-electricity interactions, the observations will be used to improve theoretical understanding and simulations of dust lifecycle. The project will provide new fundamental understanding, able to open new horizons for weather and climate science, including biogeochemistry, volcanic ash and extraterrestrial dust research.",

NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease.

Despite their importance, all proposed molecular models for transport are based on indirect evidence due to the inability of classical biophysical and biochemical techniques to directly visualize dynamic structural changes. To solve this problem, I suggest a novel approach that can decipher the molecular mechanisms of transport, with the ultimate goal to use this knowledge against pathogenic bacteria, for treatment of ABC-related diseases or multi-drug resistance of cancer cells.<br/>I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy for the study of conformational states of an ABC model system in vitro, and thus to observe directly how elementary transport steps are coordinated. This will open up a virtually unexplored biophysical research area and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC transporters. The key questions of this proposal are:<br/><br/>Aim 1: What is the mechanism of substrate binding in ABC transporters? The conformational equilibrium (open vs. closed state) of ABC-associated substrate-binding proteins will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism of binding, i.e. induced fit vs. conformational selection.<br/><br/>Aim 2: What are relevant conformational states and changes for substrate translocation? The time- and length-scales of conformational changes in transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains as well as interactions with other domains will be characterized using the osmoregulator OpuA as a model system.<br/><br/>Aim 3: How are substrate binding, energy utilization and translocation coordinated in ABC transporters? Finally, a complete model of transport will be developed to decipher the coordination of transport events, i.e. how substrate binding and ATP-hydrolysis are coupled and transferred into conformational changes that drive substrate transport.",

Strategies to generate required tissues using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are associated with either ethical or medical safety issues. An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates.

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation.

The IHM comprises several core cardiac models \u2013 electrophysiology, solid and fluid mechanics, microscopic cellular force generation, and valve dynamics \u2013 which are then coupled and finally embedded into the systemic and pulmonary blood circulations. It is a multiscale system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) featuring multiphysics interactions among the core models.<br/><br/>The physical and mathematical properties of each core model and those of the even more complex integrated heart model (IHM) will be analyzed. The numerical approximation of IHM develops along several steps: introduce new high order methods for the core models, carry out their stability and convergence analysis, devise new paradigms for their numerical coupling, and construct optimal, scalable, and adaptive preconditioners for the efficient solution of the resulting large-scale discrete problems. To address data variability in clinically relevant cases, new reduced order models and efficient computational techniques will be developed also for forward and inverse uncertainty quantification problems. Two software libraries, LifeHEART and RedHEART, will be built and made available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>The project is original, very ambitious, mathematically inspired and rigorous, tremendously challenging, and groundbreaking. If successful, it will provide researchers from applied mathematics and life sciences, cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons with a powerful tool for both the qualitative and quantitative study of cardiac function and dysfunction. iHEART has the potential to drive improvements in diagnosis and treatment for cardiovascular pathologies that are responsible for more than 45% of deaths in Europe.",

The IHM comprises several core cardiac models \u2013 electrophysiology, solid and fluid mechanics, microscopic cellular force generation, and valve dynamics \u2013 which are then coupled and finally embedded into the systemic and pulmonary blood circulations. It is a multiscale system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) featuring multiphysics interactions among the core models.<br/><br/>The physical and mathematical properties of each core model and those of the even more complex integrated heart model (IHM) will be analyzed. The numerical approximation of IHM develops along several steps: introduce new high order methods for the core models, carry out their stability and convergence analysis, devise new paradigms for their numerical coupling, and construct optimal, scalable, and adaptive preconditioners for the efficient solution of the resulting large-scale discrete problems. To address data variability in clinically relevant cases, new reduced order models and efficient computational techniques will be developed also for forward and inverse uncertainty quantification problems. Two software libraries, LifeHEART and RedHEART, will be built and made available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>The project is original, very ambitious, mathematically inspired and rigorous, tremendously challenging, and groundbreaking. If successful, it will provide researchers from applied mathematics and life sciences, cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons with a powerful tool for both the qualitative and quantitative study of cardiac function and dysfunction. iHEART has the potential to drive improvements in diagnosis and treatment for cardiovascular pathologies that are responsible for more than 45% of deaths in Europe.",

Despite the importance of gut microbiomes for host health, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. There is evidence that the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome has emerged through the diversification of a few founder lineages. However, how lineages have diversified into discrete species and which underlying mechanisms maintain the diversity in the gut remains elusive. The current project will address these questions by studying the gut microbiome of honey bees. We have recently found that the eight dominant bacterial lineages in the honey bee gut have substantially diversified, which is a striking parallelism to the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome. Moreover, we have established experiments to colonize microbiota-free bees with cultured isolates of divergent bee gut bacteria. This provides us with unique opportunities to study bacterial evolution in the gut in a simple and experimentally amenable system. The project is divided into four work packages addressing interconnected research questions of current biology: We will (i) determine the population genomic landscape of divergent gut bacteria, (ii) investigate whether bacterial diversification has resulted in competition or cooperation, (iii) discover novel mechanisms of bacterial interactions, and (iv) reveal how bacterial diversification impacts the symbiosis with the host. To this end, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining comparative metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, bee colonization experiments, microscopy, bacterial genetics, and automated bee tracking. This project situated at the forefront of microbial symbiosis will provide groundbreaking insights into microbial evolution and ecology, gut microbiology, and honey bee health and biology.",

    "project_objective": "Regenerating tissues by reprogramming cells has the potential to become a therapeutic approach for replacing lost tissues in patients suffering from injury or degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Muscular Dystrophy. Strategies to generate required tissues using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are associated with either ethical or medical safety issues. An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates. Our research has the potential to facilitate the generation of specific tissues from different cellular contexts for future biomedical approaches.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

Its usefulness has been further enhanced by the availability of genetically-encoded biosensors, which enable the visualisation of when and where a certain activity arises. In addition, the development of diffraction-unlimited imaging has dramatically improved the spatial resolution of fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques have had difficulty working with biosensors, largely limiting the information to the spatial location of the labels. <br/>This project seeks to develop diffraction-unlimited imaging of biosensors, creating activity maps with a diffraction-unlimited spatial resolution in living systems. I propose to meet this challenge using a two-pronged approach, focusing both on the development of labels and sensors as well as new imaging tools and strategies. Based on existing scaffolds, we will develop sensors that display strong photochromism, providing reversible fluorescence dynamics intrinsically suited to superresolution imaging. In tandem, we will develop imaging strategies that focus on robustness and work well in living systems, in exchange for a spatial resolution of a 50 to 70 nm and a temporal resolution of a few seconds or less. <br/>We will use these developments in the study of the nanoscale spatiotemporal regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor (GCPR) signalling in living systems.

In non-human primates, a single dose of VSV-ZEBOV elicited a strong (100%) and long-lasting protective efficacy against Ebola Zaire infections. Developed by Public Health Canada and manufactured by NewLink Genetics, VSV-ZEBOV was thus selected by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the 2 most promising vaccine candidates. To accelerate its clinical development, the WHO has organized a consortium and supported the organization of parallel first-in-man Phase I/II clinical trials, both in Europe and Africa. The primary objectives of these trials, initiated mid-November 2014, are to study the safety and antibody-inducing capacity of various doses of VSV-ZEBOV in European and African populations.<br/><br/>We propose to build upon this asset to acquire new and critical knowledge of the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited in humans by VSV-ZEBOV vaccination, with specific emphasis on trancriptomics and metabolomics signatures. To this aim, we have constructed a consortium including representatives from the vaccine manufacturer, scientists of the 3 main clinical sites (Switzerland, Gabon, Kenya) and world-leaders in immunology and partners of ADITEC, a large FP7- supported collaborative research programme aiming to accelerate the development of novel, powerful immunisation technologies for next-generation vaccines. We propose an ambitious program using cutting-edge technologies to perform an in depth characterization of the clinical samples harvested before/after VSV-ZEBOV immunization of 200 volunteers in Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya, and to extend the recently initiated clinical studies up to 12 months to identify the signatures and determinants of persistent immune responses.",

Despite the importance of gut microbiomes for host health, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. There is evidence that the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome has emerged through the diversification of a few founder lineages. However, how lineages have diversified into discrete species and which underlying mechanisms maintain the diversity in the gut remains elusive. The current project will address these questions by studying the gut microbiome of honey bees. We have recently found that the eight dominant bacterial lineages in the honey bee gut have substantially diversified, which is a striking parallelism to the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome. Moreover, we have established experiments to colonize microbiota-free bees with cultured isolates of divergent bee gut bacteria. This provides us with unique opportunities to study bacterial evolution in the gut in a simple and experimentally amenable system. The project is divided into four work packages addressing interconnected research questions of current biology: We will (i) determine the population genomic landscape of divergent gut bacteria, (ii) investigate whether bacterial diversification has resulted in competition or cooperation, (iii) discover novel mechanisms of bacterial interactions, and (iv) reveal how bacterial diversification impacts the symbiosis with the host. To this end, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining comparative metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, bee colonization experiments, microscopy, bacterial genetics, and automated bee tracking. This project situated at the forefront of microbial symbiosis will provide groundbreaking insights into microbial evolution and ecology, gut microbiology, and honey bee health and biology.",

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

Strategies to generate required tissues using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are associated with either ethical or medical safety issues. An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates.

Consensus criteria currently applied for the selection of patients for heart transplantation (HTx) leave an inconvenient margin of uncertainty, because of the unpredictable course of the disease and the shortage of donor hearts. Furthermore, monitoring graft function and adjusting immunosuppression remain major challenges after HTx.

    "project_objective": "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease in the aging population of Europe. NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

We also seek to enhance the legitimacy of the scientific processes in support of climate policymaking, by introducing an innovative stakeholder inclusion framework and improving the transparency of the employed models, methods and tools. Beyond effectively communicating respective outputs and fostering wider societal acceptance of climate policy, we actively involve policymakers and other stakeholder groups in all stages: from the formulation of policy questions and the definition of modelling assumptions in a demand-driven approach; to the design of I2AM PARIS interfaces and specifications, and the mobilisation of tacit knowledge embedded in them in the aim of bridging knowledge gaps.

    "project_objective": "It is high time for the EU to develop pathways and strategies for decarbonisation also in emissions intensive sectors such as steel, plastics, paper, and meat and dairy. These are sectors where low carbon transitions are still relatively unexplored. Some progressive companies and other actors are just beginning to consider such pathways. The overall aim of REINVENT is to help Europe achieve its long-term climate objectives, while supporting the development of other societal benefits and the economy. A new evidence-based framework to assess the viability, challenges and governance implications of decarbonisation pathways will be developed and tools provided. It builds on the integration of conceptual work, empirical mapping and case-studies of innovations and climate initiatives, co-creation of knowledge and co-design of pathways, and careful assessment of the implications for other societal goals. The approach is to study and understand transitions and emerging initiatives from within sectoral contexts where government climate policy is only one of many factors that shape perceptions and strategies. As a result, REINVENT supports systemic innovation and system-wide transformation in the studied sectors.  The project provides stakeholders with access to leading research and analytical capacity concerning key dimensions of low carbon transitions; it is also a platform for dialogue and learning about feasible pathways so that policies can be better aligned with the specific needs and conditions in different sectors. REINVENT will make an innovative scientific and societal contribution through (a) focusing on important economic sectors that are relatively unexplored yet important for the whole economy, (b) studying transitions from within these sectors, and (c) taking whole value chains into account through (d) a new analytical approach capable of advancing our understanding of key drivers, dynamics and implications of decarbonisation.",

    "project_objective": "Applied electrochemistry plays a key role in many technologies, such as batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors or solar cells. It is therefore at the core of many research programs all over the world. Yet, fundamental electrochemical investigations remain scarce. In particular, electrochemistry is among the fields for which the gap between theory and experiment is the largest. From the computational point of view, there is no molecular dynamics (MD) software devoted to the simulation of electrochemical systems while other fields such as biochemistry (GROMACS) or material science (LAMMPS) have dedicated tools. This is due to the difficulty of accounting for complex effects arising from (i) the degree of metallicity of the electrode (i.e. from semimetals to perfect conductors), (ii) the mutual polarization occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface and (iii) the redox reactivity through explicit electron transfers. Current understanding therefore relies on standard theories that derive from an inaccurate molecular-scale picture. My objective is to fill this gap by introducing a whole set of new methods for simulating electrochemical systems. They will be provided to the computational electrochemistry community as a cutting-edge MD software adapted to supercomputers. First applications will aim at the discovery of new electrolytes for energy storage. Here I will focus on (1) \u2018\u2018water-in-salts\u2019\u2019 to understand why these revolutionary liquids enable much higher voltage than conventional solutions (2) redox reactions inside a nanoporous electrode to support the development of future capacitive energy storage devices. These selected applications are timely and rely on collaborations with leading experimental partners. The results are expected to shed an unprecedented light on the importance of polarization effects on the structure and the reactivity of electrode/electrolyte interfaces, establishing MD as a prominent tool for solving complex electrochemistry problems.",

However, elastic dislocation theory combined with friction laws suggests that fluid overpressure may inhibit the dynamic instabilities that result in earthquakes. This controversy poses a serious problem in our understanding of earthquake physics, with severe implications for both natural and human-induced seismic hazard. Nevertheless, currently, there are only a few systematic studies of the role of fluid pressure under controlled, laboratory conditions for which the evolution of friction parameters and slip stability can be deduced. Here I propose a comprehensive experimental study of The role of Fluid pressure in EArthquake Triggering (FEAT). The proposed work will document the evolution of fault friction parameters as a function of fluid overpressure using a world-class rock deformation apparatus. The laboratory experiments will build on the characterization of fault zone structure, fluid flow, and deformation processes, which I intend to reconstruct from careful field evaluations of ancient faults that represent exhumed analogues of seismically active structures. An important part of my work will be the interaction with the energy industry to investigate the role of fluids in induced seismicity. <br/>The experimental work will strengthen my expertise in frictional and fluid flow characterisation of fault rocks. Additionally, I will develop new skills in electronic and mechanical engineering aspects of experiments. Field and microstructural work will widen my background in the field of structural geology, microstructural analysis and model construction using energy-industry software. These training-through-research activities will allow for the creation of unprecedented insight into the role of fluid pressure in earthquake triggering while broadening my competences via interdisciplinary studies and inter-sectorial experience.",

    "project_objective": "Fluids play an important role in fault zone and in earthquakes generation. Fluid pressure reduces the normal effective stress, lowering the frictional strength of the fault, potentially triggering earthquake ruptures. Fluid injection induced earthquakes (FIE) are direct evidence of the effect of fluid pressure on the fault strength. In addition, natural earthquake sequences are often associated with high fluid pressures at seismogenic depths. Although simple in theory, the mechanisms that govern the nucleation, propagation and recurrence of FIEs are poorly constrained, and our ability to assess the seismic hazard that is associated with natural and induced events remains limited. This project aims to enhance our knowledge of FIE mechanisms over entire seismic cycles through multidisciplinary approaches, including the following: <br/>- Set-up and installation of a new and unique rock friction apparatus that is dedicated to the study of FIEs.<br/>- Low strain rate friction experiments (coupled with electrical conductivity measurements) to investigate the influence of fluids on fault creep and earthquake recurrence. <br/>- Intermediate strain rate friction experiments to investigate the effect of fluids on fault stability during earthquake nucleation. <br/>- High strain rate friction experiments to investigate the effect of fluids on fault weakening during earthquake propagation.<br/>- Post-mortem experimental fault analyses with state-of-art microstructural techniques.<br/>- The theoretical friction law will be calibrated with friction experiments and faulted rock microstructural observations. <br/><br/>These steps will produce fundamental discoveries regarding natural earthquakes and tectonic processes and help scientists understand and eventually manage the occurrence of induced seismicity, an increasingly hot topic in geo-engineering. The sustainable exploitation of geo-resources is a key research and technology challenge at the European scale, with a substantial economical and societal impact.",

Many of the models are multiscale, requiring the coupling of two or more high performance codes. Computational biomedicine holds out the prospect of predicting the effect of personalised medical treatments and interventions ahead of carrying them out, with all the ensuing benefits. Indeed, in some cases, it is already doing so today.<br/> <br/>The CoE presents a powerful consortium of partners and has an outward facing nature and will actively train, disseminate and engage with these user communities across Europe and beyond. Because this field is new and growing rapidly, it offers numerous innovative opportunities. There are three SMEs and three enterprises within the project, as well as eight associate partners drawn from across the biomedical sector, who are fully aware of the vast potential of HPC in this domain. We shall work with them to advance the exploitation of HPC and will engage closely with medical professionals through our partner hospitals in order to establish modeling and simulation as an integral part of clinical decision making.

It is paramount to identify safe operating spaces for humanity and the planet in terms of these critical forcing levels, in order to prevent harmful transitions to alternative, undesirable states of the Earth system. The mechanisms leading to such abrupt transitions are only partly understood, and further research in this regard is urgently needed. State-of-art Earth System Models appear to respond too smoothly at TPs and have difficulties in simulating abrupt transitions that occurred in the planet\u2019s history.   TiPES will address these problems from several angles: 1. The project will identify subsystems that may exhibit abrupt transitions, and couplings between them, by focussing on paleoclimatic records and abrupt transitions therein. Novel methods to detect Early Warning Signals of forthcoming TPs, and to make skilful predictions on their basis, will be developed. 2. The potential shortcomings of models in representing TPs will be evaluated; in particular, TiPES will investigate how Bayesian calibration techniques can help enable these models to simulate past abrupt transitions.  3. TiPES will develop a generalized theory of climate sensitivity that accounts for the presence of TPs and feedbacks across various time scales.  4. To define safe operating spaces. TiPES will focus on dynamical system theory and on global stability notions for non-autonomous systems in order to estimate the stability of desirable states.  5. The results obtained by the project will be communicated to policy makers in a manner that facilitates decisions and their implementation. TiPES will develop formal approaches to define the socioeconomic risks of crossing TPs, and to derive decision strategies to keep anthropogenic forcing below levels where abrupt transitions may occur.",

These are sectors where low carbon transitions are still relatively unexplored. Some progressive companies and other actors are just beginning to consider such pathways. The overall aim of REINVENT is to help Europe achieve its long-term climate objectives, while supporting the development of other societal benefits and the economy. A new evidence-based framework to assess the viability, challenges and governance implications of decarbonisation pathways will be developed and tools provided. It builds on the integration of conceptual work, empirical mapping and case-studies of innovations and climate initiatives, co-creation of knowledge and co-design of pathways, and careful assessment of the implications for other societal goals. The approach is to study and understand transitions and emerging initiatives from within sectoral contexts where government climate policy is only one of many factors that shape perceptions and strategies. As a result, REINVENT supports systemic innovation and system-wide transformation in the studied sectors.  The project provides stakeholders with access to leading research and analytical capacity concerning key dimensions of low carbon transitions; it is also a platform for dialogue and learning about feasible pathways so that policies can be better aligned with the specific needs and conditions in different sectors. REINVENT will make an innovative scientific and societal contribution through (a) focusing on important economic sectors that are relatively unexplored yet important for the whole economy, (b) studying transitions from within these sectors, and (c) taking whole value chains into account through (d) a new analytical approach capable of advancing our understanding of key drivers, dynamics and implications of decarbonisation.",

This will cement EU science as the world-leader in understanding climate sensitivity and climate variability, deliver significantly improved capability to make climate projections for the next 20-50 years, and provide up-to-date scientific evidence for international climate policy in two phases: Phase 1 will deliver a timely characterisation of physical science uncertainty and how it affects projections and committed levels of warming to the 2021 IPCC sixth assessment report; Phase 2 will deliver constrained surface temperature projections for the 2023 UNFCCC Global Stocktake. CONSTRAIN will take full advantage of climate model integrations from the sixth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and will leverage existing H2020 and ERC projects. Novel CMIP6 analyses will be combined with dedicated high resolution simulations and new observations to address identified knowledge gaps on radiative forcing, cloud feedbacks and the relationship between ocean variability and atmospheric change. A fourth identified knowledge gap is the effective translation of new physical science understanding into an improved evidence base for policy decisions. CONSTRAIN will address this by developing climate model emulators that integrate and operationalise learning from across the consortium to provide new capability to assess impacts of climate change under a broad range of emission scenarios.

Three related user communities lie at the heart of the CoE: academic, industrial and clinical researchers who all wish to build, develop and extend such capabilities in line with the increasing power of high performance computers. Three distinct exemplar research areas will be pursued: cardiovascular, molecularly-based and neuro-musculoskeletal medicine.<br/> <br/>Predictive computational biomedicine involves applications that are comprised of multiple components, arranged as far as possible into automated workflows in which data is taken, from an individual patient, processed, and combined into a model which produces predicted health outcomes. Many of the models are multiscale, requiring the coupling of two or more high performance codes. Computational biomedicine holds out the prospect of predicting the effect of personalised medical treatments and interventions ahead of carrying them out, with all the ensuing benefits. Indeed, in some cases, it is already doing so today.<br/> <br/>The CoE presents a powerful consortium of partners and has an outward facing nature and will actively train, disseminate and engage with these user communities across Europe and beyond. Because this field is new and growing rapidly, it offers numerous innovative opportunities. There are three SMEs and three enterprises within the project, as well as eight associate partners drawn from across the biomedical sector, who are fully aware of the vast potential of HPC in this domain. We shall work with them to advance the exploitation of HPC and will engage closely with medical professionals through our partner hospitals in order to establish modeling and simulation as an integral part of clinical decision making.

However, the underlying deformation mechanisms remain ambiguous, particularly in the presence of strain gradients. In this project, we intend to develop an integrated micro-torsion and micro-tension technique with a heating and temperature-control element for investigating the mechanical behavior of micro-scale metallic wires/tubes at elevated temperatures. We study all three size effects, due to the grain size, due to nonuniform deformation, and due to the wire diameter, and their coupling effects, using samples with different diameters (or wall thickness) and controlled grain sizes. The Fellow has reported the first observation of anomalous plasticity in the cyclic torsion of micro-scale metallic wires at room temperature. However, there have been no reports on the phenomenon in the cyclic torsion of small volumes at elevated temperatures. In this proposal, we plan to perform the (cyclic) torsion tests on micron-scale metallic wires and tubes which are heated in situ by passing an electrical current, and then to analyze the relation between plastic recovery and temperature.

The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

    "project_objective": "Animals harbor specialized bacterial communities in their guts, typically referred to as gut microbiomes. Despite the importance of gut microbiomes for host health, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. There is evidence that the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome has emerged through the diversification of a few founder lineages. However, how lineages have diversified into discrete species and which underlying mechanisms maintain the diversity in the gut remains elusive. The current project will address these questions by studying the gut microbiome of honey bees. We have recently found that the eight dominant bacterial lineages in the honey bee gut have substantially diversified, which is a striking parallelism to the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome. Moreover, we have established experiments to colonize microbiota-free bees with cultured isolates of divergent bee gut bacteria. This provides us with unique opportunities to study bacterial evolution in the gut in a simple and experimentally amenable system. The project is divided into four work packages addressing interconnected research questions of current biology: We will (i) determine the population genomic landscape of divergent gut bacteria, (ii) investigate whether bacterial diversification has resulted in competition or cooperation, (iii) discover novel mechanisms of bacterial interactions, and (iv) reveal how bacterial diversification impacts the symbiosis with the host. To this end, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining comparative metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, bee colonization experiments, microscopy, bacterial genetics, and automated bee tracking. This project situated at the forefront of microbial symbiosis will provide groundbreaking insights into microbial evolution and ecology, gut microbiology, and honey bee health and biology.",

      "Abstract The production of commodities by energy-intensive industry is responsible for 1/3 of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.",
      "The climate goal of the Paris Agreement, to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u202f\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u202f\u00b0C, requires global GHG emissions reach net-zero and probably negative by 2055\u20132080.",
      "Given the average economic lifetime of industrial facilities is 20 years or more, this indicates all new investment must be net-zero emitting by 2035\u20132060 or be compensated by negative emissions to guarantee GHG-neutrality.",
      "We argue, based on a sample portfolio of emerging and near-commercial technologies for each sector (largely based on zero carbon electricity & heat sources, biomass and carbon capture, and catalogued in an accompanying database), that reducing energy-intensive industrial GHG emissions to Paris Agreement compatible levels may not only be technically possible, but can be achieved with sufficient prioritization and policy effort.",
      "We then review policy options to drive innovation and investment in these technologies.",
      "From this we synthesize a preliminary integrated strategy for a managed transition with minimum stranded assets, unemployment, and social trauma that recognizes the competitive and globally traded nature of commodity production.",
      "The strategy includes: an initial policy commitment followed by a national and sectoral stakeholder driven pathway process to build commitment and identify opportunities based on local zero carbon resources; penetration of near-commercial technologies through increasing valuation of GHG material intensity through GHG pricing or tradable performance based regulations with protection for competitiveness and against carbon leakage; research and demand support for the output of pilot plants, including some combination of guaranteed above-market prices that decline with output and an increasing requirement for low carbon inputs in government procurement; and finally, key supporting institutions."

Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

      "Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria were tested.",

      "The best thresholds to rule-out VNT were identified as platelet count >110,000/mm3 and LSM <30 kPa for M probe, and platelet count >110,000/mm3 and LSM <25 kPa for XL probe (NAFLD cirrhosis criteria).",
      "Thus, usage of NAFLD cirrhosis criteria would have led to an absolute reduction in the number of EGD screened patients of 34.7% and 10.5% with respect to Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria, respectively.",
      "Conclusion: The new NAFLD cirrhosis criteria, established for the FibroScan probe, can reduce the use of EGD for screening of VNT in NAFLD cirrhosis by more than half, with a chance of missing VNT below 5%."

Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

As such, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and effective prevention and treatment strategies. As numerous clinical trials have shown, lifestyle modification is by far the best way to prevent these diseases, with lifestyle being twice as effective as the best drugs, less costly and free from side effects. Yet, human biology is complex, causing some people to respond well and others poorly to the same lifestyle interventions. Thus, a huge, as yet unrealised opportunity exists to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases by tailoring lifestyle interventions to the patient\u2019s unique biology. <br/>NASCENT is an integrated programme of research through which I will functionally annotate and later translate discoveries of gene-lifestyle interactions made through the interrogation of large epidemiological (N>100,000) datasets at my disposal. The functional annotation of these discoveries will be done using state-of-the-art epigenomic and targeted gene editing tools, whereas the translation of those findings will be achieved using a innovative and powerful clinical trial design that focuses on treatments that are tailored to the participant\u2019s genotype (genotype-based recall). <br/>NASCENT capitalizes on a solid foundation of cohorts, methods, and expertise that I have built-up over the past fifteen years, but also exploits state-of-the-art epigenomic and gene-editing technologies that have not previously been used in studies of gene-lifestyle interactions. I expect the integration of these established and new approaches in NASCENT to propel major advances in understanding gene-lifestyle interactions in cardiometabolic disease that help optimise disease prevention.",

    "project_objective": "Alcohol overuse is an important societal challenge with annual healthcare costs of over \u20ac22 billion in Europe. Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

    "project_objective": "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease in the aging population of Europe. NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

    "project_objective": "Animals harbor specialized bacterial communities in their guts, typically referred to as gut microbiomes. Despite the importance of gut microbiomes for host health, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. There is evidence that the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome has emerged through the diversification of a few founder lineages. However, how lineages have diversified into discrete species and which underlying mechanisms maintain the diversity in the gut remains elusive. The current project will address these questions by studying the gut microbiome of honey bees. We have recently found that the eight dominant bacterial lineages in the honey bee gut have substantially diversified, which is a striking parallelism to the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome. Moreover, we have established experiments to colonize microbiota-free bees with cultured isolates of divergent bee gut bacteria. This provides us with unique opportunities to study bacterial evolution in the gut in a simple and experimentally amenable system. The project is divided into four work packages addressing interconnected research questions of current biology: We will (i) determine the population genomic landscape of divergent gut bacteria, (ii) investigate whether bacterial diversification has resulted in competition or cooperation, (iii) discover novel mechanisms of bacterial interactions, and (iv) reveal how bacterial diversification impacts the symbiosis with the host. To this end, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining comparative metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, bee colonization experiments, microscopy, bacterial genetics, and automated bee tracking. This project situated at the forefront of microbial symbiosis will provide groundbreaking insights into microbial evolution and ecology, gut microbiology, and honey bee health and biology.",

As adherent cells also read their environment through substrate interactions there is a great interest in developing such substrates in a predictable manner. Their first point of contact is through their focal adhesions and it is also though them that forces are applied allowing the cell to migrate and establish cytoskeletal tension which in turn regulates cell function. The objective of this project is to investigate the cell-substrate interaction at the nanoscale and correlate that to the surface topography for predictable biomaterials. Through the application of state-of-the-art nanofabrication we will fabricate precise surface topographies with length scales comparable to the structural units found in the focal adhesions. The aim is to map and understand the topographical influence in the architectural arrangement of the proteins in the adhesions. Aided by high resolution microscopy we will classify cell types on different nanotopographies. Combining that information with machine learning, we will be able to gain information about cell characteristics from the rule set. That information can also be used in reverse to identify cell types with the previously defined characteristic. This approach is similar to face recognition seen on cameras and mobile phones.<br/> <br/>The proposed research project will not only provide insight to an area of biomaterials not previously explored, yet aim to provide a blueprint for future design of biomaterials.",

They will open up for efficient dissection of important signaling networks and development of drugs with fewer side effects. <br/><br/>DE-ORPHANs design hypotheses are based on unique computational methods to analyze protein and ligand similarities and are founded on genomic and protein sequences, structural data and ligands. The interdisciplinary research strategy applies multiple ligands acting independently but in concert to provide complementary receptor characterization. The results will allow the research field to advance into studies of receptor functions and exploitation of druggable targets, ligands and mechanisms. Which physiological insights and therapeutic breakthroughs will we witness when these receptors find their place in human pharmacology and medicine?",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

    "project_objective": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord affecting some 40,000 individuals in Europe, causing 11,000 deaths each year. Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Despite extensive mass drug administration (MDA) schistosomiasis remains a major public health issue, with a socio-economic impact second only to malaria amongst parasites. I will evaluate novel strategies and new technologies to monitor the impact of MDA programmes, to identify threats to MDA effectiveness, and enhance control of schistosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Specifically I will address five ambitious questions:<br/>1. What is the best way to monitor schistosome infections and drug efficacy?<br/>2. Has drug resistance been selected for?<br/>3. What is the potential for drug resistance to spread?<br/>4. What other factors drive transmission?<br/>5. What other factors affect parasite clearance?<br/><br/>These aims are feasible through innovative interdisciplinary methods including a) state-of-the-art DNA-chip diagnostics, b) novel application of genetic analysis to differentiate surviving worms from juveniles, c) use of drug screening technology to measure in vitro drug susceptibility, providing the first quantifiable in vitro phenotype without using mammals, d) combination of molecular techniques with mathematical models to elucidate the potential spread of phenotypes and e) an unparalleled interdisciplinary approach deducing host effects in non-clearers.<br/><br/>These methods and technologies have not previously been used to assess MDA effectiveness for any helminth infection. My pioneering research will enable a comparative assessment of how transmission is affected by untreated adults and pre-school children, individuals with heavy infections, coinfections, and drug coverage. This will elucidate optimal strategies to reduce transmission hotspots.<br/><br/>My results will improve monitoring protocols and inform policy makers on how best to treat schistosomiasis. I will fill a critical global health knowledge gap, with findings transferable across a range of MDA controlled diseases.",

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

Despite their importance, all proposed molecular models for transport are based on indirect evidence due to the inability of classical biophysical and biochemical techniques to directly visualize dynamic structural changes. To solve this problem, I suggest a novel approach that can decipher the molecular mechanisms of transport, with the ultimate goal to use this knowledge against pathogenic bacteria, for treatment of ABC-related diseases or multi-drug resistance of cancer cells.<br/>I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy for the study of conformational states of an ABC model system in vitro, and thus to observe directly how elementary transport steps are coordinated. This will open up a virtually unexplored biophysical research area and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC transporters. The key questions of this proposal are:<br/><br/>Aim 1: What is the mechanism of substrate binding in ABC transporters? The conformational equilibrium (open vs. closed state) of ABC-associated substrate-binding proteins will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism of binding, i.e. induced fit vs. conformational selection.<br/><br/>Aim 2: What are relevant conformational states and changes for substrate translocation? The time- and length-scales of conformational changes in transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains as well as interactions with other domains will be characterized using the osmoregulator OpuA as a model system.<br/><br/>Aim 3: How are substrate binding, energy utilization and translocation coordinated in ABC transporters? Finally, a complete model of transport will be developed to decipher the coordination of transport events, i.e. how substrate binding and ATP-hydrolysis are coupled and transferred into conformational changes that drive substrate transport.",

These are sectors where low carbon transitions are still relatively unexplored. Some progressive companies and other actors are just beginning to consider such pathways. The overall aim of REINVENT is to help Europe achieve its long-term climate objectives, while supporting the development of other societal benefits and the economy. A new evidence-based framework to assess the viability, challenges and governance implications of decarbonisation pathways will be developed and tools provided. It builds on the integration of conceptual work, empirical mapping and case-studies of innovations and climate initiatives, co-creation of knowledge and co-design of pathways, and careful assessment of the implications for other societal goals. The approach is to study and understand transitions and emerging initiatives from within sectoral contexts where government climate policy is only one of many factors that shape perceptions and strategies. As a result, REINVENT supports systemic innovation and system-wide transformation in the studied sectors.  The project provides stakeholders with access to leading research and analytical capacity concerning key dimensions of low carbon transitions; it is also a platform for dialogue and learning about feasible pathways so that policies can be better aligned with the specific needs and conditions in different sectors. REINVENT will make an innovative scientific and societal contribution through (a) focusing on important economic sectors that are relatively unexplored yet important for the whole economy, (b) studying transitions from within these sectors, and (c) taking whole value chains into account through (d) a new analytical approach capable of advancing our understanding of key drivers, dynamics and implications of decarbonisation.",

For this reason, there is an urgent need to understand the effect of ecological and evolutionary processes caused by past climate change on range dynamics. In fact, adaptation of plant populations in fitness-related traits to different local climate condition might enable species to take on future climate change. In general, species performance (genetics, physiology, morphology and demography) is predicted to decline gradually from population growing in the climatic optimum (central population) to population growing in harsh climate conditions (peripheral populations). However, studies aimed to analyse differences between central and peripheral populations relate this differences with only one or two possible causal factors (i.e. historical, ecological or biogeographic factor), without distinguishing between geographical, environmental and historical isolation. For this reason, the goal of our project is to evaluate whether the environmental (ecological niche), historical (biogeographical processes) and geographical barriers may explain difference in both gene diversity and fitness-related floral traits between central and peripheral populations in Lilium pomponium, a species potentially prone to extinction risk because of range loss induced by climate change and spanning across Mediterranean to Alpine climate. The originality and interdisciplinarity of this research programme lies into integrate ecological niche characteristics together with current and past range structure to investigate evolutionary processes that have affected spatial patterns of genetic and demographic variation across species ranges combining different research fields in evolutionary biology as reproductive biology, ecology, phylogeography and population genetics.",

    "project_objective": "The proposal, VSV-EBOVAC, directly addresses the topic 1 of the IMI2 call on Ebola by supporting the clinical development of a highly promising new Ebola vaccine candidate, the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)\u2010 vectored Zaire Ebola vaccine (VSV-ZEBOV). In non-human primates, a single dose of VSV-ZEBOV elicited a strong (100%) and long-lasting protective efficacy against Ebola Zaire infections. Developed by Public Health Canada and manufactured by NewLink Genetics, VSV-ZEBOV was thus selected by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the 2 most promising vaccine candidates. To accelerate its clinical development, the WHO has organized a consortium and supported the organization of parallel first-in-man Phase I/II clinical trials, both in Europe and Africa. The primary objectives of these trials, initiated mid-November 2014, are to study the safety and antibody-inducing capacity of various doses of VSV-ZEBOV in European and African populations.<br/><br/>We propose to build upon this asset to acquire new and critical knowledge of the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited in humans by VSV-ZEBOV vaccination, with specific emphasis on trancriptomics and metabolomics signatures. To this aim, we have constructed a consortium including representatives from the vaccine manufacturer, scientists of the 3 main clinical sites (Switzerland, Gabon, Kenya) and world-leaders in immunology and partners of ADITEC, a large FP7- supported collaborative research programme aiming to accelerate the development of novel, powerful immunisation technologies for next-generation vaccines. We propose an ambitious program using cutting-edge technologies to perform an in depth characterization of the clinical samples harvested before/after VSV-ZEBOV immunization of 200 volunteers in Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya, and to extend the recently initiated clinical studies up to 12 months to identify the signatures and determinants of persistent immune responses.",

    "project_objective": "TREATMENT is a Marie Sklodowska Curie Innovative Training Network proposal directly addressing the need for high-level training and career paths in risk evaluation of drug induced metabolic dysfunctions, a relevant aspect, so far unexplored by traditional toxicology studies, but urgently needed to challenge current severe limitations of health care interventions in mental disorders. These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

    "project_objective": "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease in the aging population of Europe. NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

    "project_objective": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with a prevalence of 1.5-2% in European populations. By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

What other factors drive transmission?<br/>5. What other factors affect parasite clearance?<br/><br/>These aims are feasible through innovative interdisciplinary methods including a) state-of-the-art DNA-chip diagnostics, b) novel application of genetic analysis to differentiate surviving worms from juveniles, c) use of drug screening technology to measure in vitro drug susceptibility, providing the first quantifiable in vitro phenotype without using mammals, d) combination of molecular techniques with mathematical models to elucidate the potential spread of phenotypes and e) an unparalleled interdisciplinary approach deducing host effects in non-clearers.<br/><br/>These methods and technologies have not previously been used to assess MDA effectiveness for any helminth infection.

ZIKAlliance will addrees three key objectives relating to (i) impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy and short & medium term effects on newborns, (ii) associated natural history of ZIKV infection in humans and their environment in the context of other circulating arboviruses and (iii) building the overall capacity for preparedness research for future epidemic threats in Latin America & the Caribbean. The project will take advantage of large standardised clinical cohorts of pregnant women and febrile patients in regions of Latin America and the Caribbean were the virus is circulating, expanding a preexisting network established by the IDAMS EU project. I will also benefit of a very strong expertise in basic and environmental sciences, with access to both field work and sophisticated technological infrastructures to characterise virus replication and physiopathology mechanisms. To meet its 3 key objectives, the scientific project has been organised in 9 work packages, with WP2/3 dedicated to clinical research (cohorts, clinical biology, epidemiology & modeling), WP3/4 to basic research (virology & antivirals, pathophysiology & animal models), WP5/6 to environmental research (animal reservoirs, vectors & vector control) , WP7/8 to social sciences & communication, and WP9 to management.

    "project_objective": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord affecting some 40,000 individuals in Europe, causing 11,000 deaths each year. Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

      "This is the case because, without access to evolutionary control for finely tuned biological catalysts, the inability to correct errors or harness multiple competing processes means that the prospects for digital control of polymerization have been firmly bootstrapped to biological systems or limited to stepwise synthetic protocols.\\ud \\ud In this Account, we give an overview of strategies that have been used over the last 5 years in efforts to program polymer synthesis with sequence control in the laboratory.",

      "In addition to those, we highlight the importance of environmental bias in possible control of polymerization at the single-unit level, such as using catalyst switching or external stimuli.\\ud \\ud Even the most successful experimental sequence control approach needs appropriate tools to verify its scope and validity; therefore, we devote part of the present Account to possible analytical approaches to sequence readout, starting with well-established tandem mass spectrometry techniques and touching on those more applicable to specific classes of processes, such as diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy.",

Despite their importance, all proposed molecular models for transport are based on indirect evidence due to the inability of classical biophysical and biochemical techniques to directly visualize dynamic structural changes. To solve this problem, I suggest a novel approach that can decipher the molecular mechanisms of transport, with the ultimate goal to use this knowledge against pathogenic bacteria, for treatment of ABC-related diseases or multi-drug resistance of cancer cells.<br/>I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy for the study of conformational states of an ABC model system in vitro, and thus to observe directly how elementary transport steps are coordinated. This will open up a virtually unexplored biophysical research area and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC transporters. The key questions of this proposal are:<br/><br/>Aim 1: What is the mechanism of substrate binding in ABC transporters? The conformational equilibrium (open vs. closed state) of ABC-associated substrate-binding proteins will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism of binding, i.e. induced fit vs. conformational selection.<br/><br/>Aim 2: What are relevant conformational states and changes for substrate translocation? The time- and length-scales of conformational changes in transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains as well as interactions with other domains will be characterized using the osmoregulator OpuA as a model system.<br/><br/>Aim 3: How are substrate binding, energy utilization and translocation coordinated in ABC transporters?

In order to secure a widespread application of these reactions in organic synthesis and in order to make the respective products available for high-tech applications, it is required that photochemical reactions can be performed enantioselectively, i.e. that the three-dimensional architecture of the product molecules is unambiguously defined. Despite some progress in recent years, this challenge has as yet remained unsolved. It is the objective of this proposal to develop catalytic methods that allow the enantioselective synthesis of a broad variety of compound classes by light-induced reactions. The mode of action of potential catalysts is based on energy transfer or on wavelength-selective excitation. In the former scenario, the substrate-catalyst complex will be held together by non-covalent interactions, which position the substrate for an efficient energy transfer and for an enantioselective approach of the reagent. In the latter approach, acid-base interactions in the substrate-catalyst complex will lead to a significant bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate, enabling a selective excitation within the complex and a subsequent enantioselective reaction pathway within a spatially defined chiral environment. Both approaches include the option to employ sunlight as the exclusive energy source to drive enantioselective processes without the need to apply external heat or pressure.",

Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

Despite their importance, all proposed molecular models for transport are based on indirect evidence due to the inability of classical biophysical and biochemical techniques to directly visualize dynamic structural changes. To solve this problem, I suggest a novel approach that can decipher the molecular mechanisms of transport, with the ultimate goal to use this knowledge against pathogenic bacteria, for treatment of ABC-related diseases or multi-drug resistance of cancer cells.<br/>I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy for the study of conformational states of an ABC model system in vitro, and thus to observe directly how elementary transport steps are coordinated. This will open up a virtually unexplored biophysical research area and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC transporters. The key questions of this proposal are:<br/><br/>Aim 1: What is the mechanism of substrate binding in ABC transporters? The conformational equilibrium (open vs. closed state) of ABC-associated substrate-binding proteins will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism of binding, i.e. induced fit vs. conformational selection.<br/><br/>Aim 2: What are relevant conformational states and changes for substrate translocation? The time- and length-scales of conformational changes in transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains as well as interactions with other domains will be characterized using the osmoregulator OpuA as a model system.<br/><br/>Aim 3: How are substrate binding, energy utilization and translocation coordinated in ABC transporters? Finally, a complete model of transport will be developed to decipher the coordination of transport events, i.e. how substrate binding and ATP-hydrolysis are coupled and transferred into conformational changes that drive substrate transport.",

As for many heterogeneous catalysts, the characterization of the gold NPs morphology in operating conditions is essential for progress towards practical use. The issue is currently treated by X-ray diffraction at synchrotron radiation facilities. The present project (OSCAR) foresees a breakthrough. It aims to develop an optical method, namely Surface Differential Reflectivity Spectroscopy (SDRS), to determine operando at the laboratory the shape and size of NPs on the basis of their plasmonic response. The challenge is to combine non-invasive SDRS measurements for determining NP morphology to reactivity measurements in realistic conditions.

As adherent cells also read their environment through substrate interactions there is a great interest in developing such substrates in a predictable manner. Their first point of contact is through their focal adhesions and it is also though them that forces are applied allowing the cell to migrate and establish cytoskeletal tension which in turn regulates cell function. The objective of this project is to investigate the cell-substrate interaction at the nanoscale and correlate that to the surface topography for predictable biomaterials. Through the application of state-of-the-art nanofabrication we will fabricate precise surface topographies with length scales comparable to the structural units found in the focal adhesions. The aim is to map and understand the topographical influence in the architectural arrangement of the proteins in the adhesions. Aided by high resolution microscopy we will classify cell types on different nanotopographies. Combining that information with machine learning, we will be able to gain information about cell characteristics from the rule set. That information can also be used in reverse to identify cell types with the previously defined characteristic.

    "project_objective": "We outline a 5 year programme that introduces a new platform for the preparation, understanding, and exploitation of precisely defined nano-molecules / materials based upon the assembly of molecular metal oxide precursors (polyoxometalates) under non-equilibrium conditions with well-defined physical properties using automated intelligent feedback. We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

      "This highlights the potential of IMS3 as an alternative, superior approach to consecutively performed immuno-based A\u03b2 staining strategies.",

The project will take advantage of large standardised clinical cohorts of pregnant women and febrile patients in regions of Latin America and the Caribbean were the virus is circulating, expanding a preexisting network established by the IDAMS EU project. I will also benefit of a very strong expertise in basic and environmental sciences, with access to both field work and sophisticated technological infrastructures to characterise virus replication and physiopathology mechanisms. To meet its 3 key objectives, the scientific project has been organised in 9 work packages, with WP2/3 dedicated to clinical research (cohorts, clinical biology, epidemiology & modeling), WP3/4 to basic research (virology & antivirals, pathophysiology & animal models), WP5/6 to environmental research (animal reservoirs, vectors & vector control) , WP7/8 to social sciences & communication, and WP9 to management.

In order to secure a widespread application of these reactions in organic synthesis and in order to make the respective products available for high-tech applications, it is required that photochemical reactions can be performed enantioselectively, i.e. that the three-dimensional architecture of the product molecules is unambiguously defined. Despite some progress in recent years, this challenge has as yet remained unsolved. It is the objective of this proposal to develop catalytic methods that allow the enantioselective synthesis of a broad variety of compound classes by light-induced reactions. The mode of action of potential catalysts is based on energy transfer or on wavelength-selective excitation. In the former scenario, the substrate-catalyst complex will be held together by non-covalent interactions, which position the substrate for an efficient energy transfer and for an enantioselective approach of the reagent. In the latter approach, acid-base interactions in the substrate-catalyst complex will lead to a significant bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate, enabling a selective excitation within the complex and a subsequent enantioselective reaction pathway within a spatially defined chiral environment. Both approaches include the option to employ sunlight as the exclusive energy source to drive enantioselective processes without the need to apply external heat or pressure.",

We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

Despite many successes, a number of key questions still remain, which are of the uttermost importance to understand plate tectonics. What is the nature of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary? What is the structure and history of the continental lithosphere? <br/><br/>The problem is that different seismic observables sample the Earth at different scales; they have different sensitivity to structure, and are usually interpreted separately. Images obtained from short period converted and reflected body waves see sharp discontinuities, and are interpreted in terms of thermo-chemical stratification, whereas seismic models constructed from long period seismograms depict a smooth and anisotropic upper mantle, and are usually interpreted in terms of mantle flow. However, sharp discontinuities may also produce effective anisotropy at large scales, and only a joint interpretation of different frequency bands can allow to fully localizing the patterns of deformation in the mantle. <br/><br/>The proposed work consists in developing and applying an entirely new approach to geophysical data interpretation, where different data types sampling the Earth at different scales are jointly embraced into a single Bayesian procedure. This proposal focuses on theoretical, algorithmic and computational advances needed for a new generation of tomographic models. We will use the large amount of data available in North-America (surface wave measurements, scattered body waves, SKS splitting measurements) to produce a multiscale model under North-America, depicting both discontinuities and anisotropy. This will allow us to answer some crucial questions about the structure and evolution of Earth. We will also produce a first fully Bayesian global Earth model by jointly inverting normal modes, surface and body wave observations.",

Fluid pressure reduces the normal effective stress, lowering the frictional strength of the fault, potentially triggering earthquake ruptures. Fluid injection induced earthquakes (FIE) are direct evidence of the effect of fluid pressure on the fault strength. In addition, natural earthquake sequences are often associated with high fluid pressures at seismogenic depths. Although simple in theory, the mechanisms that govern the nucleation, propagation and recurrence of FIEs are poorly constrained, and our ability to assess the seismic hazard that is associated with natural and induced events remains limited. This project aims to enhance our knowledge of FIE mechanisms over entire seismic cycles through multidisciplinary approaches, including the following: <br/>- Set-up and installation of a new and unique rock friction apparatus that is dedicated to the study of FIEs.<br/>- Low strain rate friction experiments (coupled with electrical conductivity measurements) to investigate the influence of fluids on fault creep and earthquake recurrence. <br/>- Intermediate strain rate friction experiments to investigate the effect of fluids on fault stability during earthquake nucleation. <br/>- High strain rate friction experiments to investigate the effect of fluids on fault weakening during earthquake propagation.<br/>- Post-mortem experimental fault analyses with state-of-art microstructural techniques.<br/>- The theoretical friction law will be calibrated with friction experiments and faulted rock microstructural observations. <br/><br/>These steps will produce fundamental discoveries regarding natural earthquakes and tectonic processes and help scientists understand and eventually manage the occurrence of induced seismicity, an increasingly hot topic in geo-engineering.

Despite many successes, a number of key questions still remain, which are of the uttermost importance to understand plate tectonics. What is the nature of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary? What is the structure and history of the continental lithosphere? <br/><br/>The problem is that different seismic observables sample the Earth at different scales; they have different sensitivity to structure, and are usually interpreted separately. Images obtained from short period converted and reflected body waves see sharp discontinuities, and are interpreted in terms of thermo-chemical stratification, whereas seismic models constructed from long period seismograms depict a smooth and anisotropic upper mantle, and are usually interpreted in terms of mantle flow. However, sharp discontinuities may also produce effective anisotropy at large scales, and only a joint interpretation of different frequency bands can allow to fully localizing the patterns of deformation in the mantle. <br/><br/>The proposed work consists in developing and applying an entirely new approach to geophysical data interpretation, where different data types sampling the Earth at different scales are jointly embraced into a single Bayesian procedure. This proposal focuses on theoretical, algorithmic and computational advances needed for a new generation of tomographic models. We will use the large amount of data available in North-America (surface wave measurements, scattered body waves, SKS splitting measurements) to produce a multiscale model under North-America, depicting both discontinuities and anisotropy. This will allow us to answer some crucial questions about the structure and evolution of Earth. We will also produce a first fully Bayesian global Earth model by jointly inverting normal modes, surface and body wave observations.",

This will be achieved through innovative integration of models and observations, providing new constraints on modelled carbon-climate interactions and climate projections, and supporting IPCC assessments and policy objectives. To meet this objective, 4C will (a) provide a step change in our ability to quantify the key processes regulating the coupled carbon-climate system, (b) use observational constraints and improved processes understanding to provide multi-model near-term predictions and long-term projections of the climate in response to anthropogenic emissions, and (c) deliver policy-relevant carbon dioxide emission pathways consistent with the UNFCCC Paris Agreement (PA) goals.  <br/>To achieve its goals, 4C will develop and use: state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) including biogeochemical processes not included in previous IPCC reports; novel observations to constrain the contemporary carbon cycle and its natural variability; ESM-based decadal predictions including carbon-climate feedbacks and novel initialisation methods; novel emergent constraints and weighting methods to reduce uncertainty in carbon cycle and climate projections; and novel climate scenarios following adaptive CO2 emission pathways. <br/>4C will support two central elements of the PA. First, the PA global stocktakes, by providing policy-relevant predictions of atmospheric CO2 and climate in response to the national determined contributions. Second, the PA ambitions to keep global warming well below 2\u00b0C, by providing robust estimates of the remaining carbon budgets and available pathways. 4C will bring together leading European groups on climate modelling and on carbon cycle research, uniquely securing Europe\u2019s leadership in actionable science needed for the IPCC assessments.",

      "To sample the range of plausible aerosol and atmospheric states and perform robust statistical analyses of the radiative forcing, it is important to account for the combined effects of many sources of model uncertainty, which is rarely done due to the high computational cost.",

      "The first ensemble was designed to comprehensively sample uncertainty in the aerosol state, while the other samples additional uncertainties in the physical model related to clouds, humidity, and radiation, thereby allowing an analysis of uncertainty in the aerosol effective radiative forcing.",
      "Each ensemble consists of around 200 simulations of the preindustrial and present\u2010day atmospheres.",
      "The uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing in our ensembles is comparable to the range of estimates from multimodel intercomparison projects.",

This capability will deliver innovative climate science and a new generation of advanced Earth System Models. Sector-specific end-users in policy and business will be identified and engaged individually, with iterative feedback, to ensure that new climate information is tailored, actionable and strengthening societal risk management decisions.<br/>These goals will be achieved through the development of coupled GCMs from seven groups across Europe, with sufficient resolution to reproduce realistic weather and climate features (~25km mesh size), in addition to enhanced process parameterisation. Thorough assessment will use innovative process-based metrics and the latest observational and reanalysis datasets. Targeted experimental design will reduce inter-model spread and produce robust projections, forming the European contribution to the CMIP6 High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, led by PRIMAVERA. <br/>It is the first time that high-resolution coupled GCMs will be used under a single experimental protocol. Coordination, and the underlying process-understanding, will significantly increase the robustness of our findings. Our new capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the drivers of variability and change in European climate, including extremes, since such regional changes continue to be characterised by high uncertainty. <br/>We will also explore the frontiers of climate modelling and of high performance computing to produce simulations with a reduced reliance on physical parameterisations. These will explicitly resolve key processes such as ocean eddies, and will include new stochastic parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes. These \u201cfrontiers\u201d simulations will further our understanding of the robustness of climate projections.",

We will experimentally determine the contribution of induced BVOC emissions from insect herbivory in the warming Arctic by field manipulation experiments addressing basal herbivory and insect outbreaks and by stable isotope labelling to identify sources of the induced emission. Complementary laboratory assessment will determine if permafrost thaw leads to significant BVOC emissions from thawing processes and newly available soil processes, or if released BVOCs are largely taken up by soil microbes. We will also use a global network of existing climate warming experiments in alpine tundra to assess how the BVOC emissions from tundra vegetation world-wide respond to climate change.<br/>Measurement data will help develop and parameterize BVOC emission models to produce holistic enhanced predictions for global tundra emissions. Finally, modelling will be used to estimate emission impact on tropospheric ozone concentrations and secondary organic aerosol levels, producing the first assessment of arctic BVOC-mediated feedback on regional air quality and climate.",

We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

    "project_objective": "The Land Biosphere is a critical component of the Earth System, linking to climate through multiple feedback processes. Understanding these feedback processes is a huge intellectual challenge. In part because of the pioneering work of the PI (Cox et al., 2000), many of the climate projections reported in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) now include climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. However the latest Earth System Models (ESMs) continue to show a huge range in the projected responses of the land carbon cycle over the 21st century. This uncertainty threatens to undermine the value of these projections to inform climate policy.  This project (ECCLES) is designed to produce significant reductions in the uncertainties associated with land-climate interactions, using the novel concept of Emergent Constraints - relationships between future projections and observable variations in the current Earth System that are common across the ensemble of ESMs. Emergent Constraints have many attractive features but chief amongst these is that they can make ensembles of ESMs more than the sum of the parts - allowing the full range of ESM projections to be used collectively, alongside key observations, to reduce uncertainties in the future climate. The project will deliver: (i) a theoretical foundation for Emergent Constraints; (ii) new datasets on the changing function of the land biosphere; (iii) Emergent Constraints on land-climate interactions based on observed temporal and spatial variations; (iv) a new generation of scientists expert in land-climate interactions and Emergent Constraints. ECCLES will benefit from the expertise and experience of the PI, which includes training as a theoretical physicist, an early career developing models of the land biosphere for ESMs, and a current career in a department of mathematics where he is at the forefront of efforts to develop and apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (Cox et al., 2013, Wenzel et al., 2016).",

      "The seemingly intractable range of ECS estimates complicates policy making because the response of the real climate system to the lowest and highest predicted temperature change would translate into radically different policy options.",
      "Peter Cox and colleagues now constrain climate models by their ability to simulate observed variations in climate, and conclude that ECS has a central estimate of 2.8 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C), which sits towards the middle to lower end of current estimates, and a range of 2.2\u20133.4 \u00b0C.",

      "Our approach is to focus on the variability of temperature about long-term historical warming, rather than on the warming trend itself.",
      "We use an ensemble of climate models to define an emergent relationship2 between ECS and a theoretically informed metric of global temperature variability.",
      "This metric of variability can also be calculated from observational records of global warming3, which enables tighter constraints to be placed on ECS, reducing the probability of ECS being less than 1.5 degrees Celsius to less than 3 per cent, and the probability of ECS exceeding 4.5 degrees Celsius to less than 1 per cent."

Despite their importance, all proposed molecular models for transport are based on indirect evidence due to the inability of classical biophysical and biochemical techniques to directly visualize dynamic structural changes. To solve this problem, I suggest a novel approach that can decipher the molecular mechanisms of transport, with the ultimate goal to use this knowledge against pathogenic bacteria, for treatment of ABC-related diseases or multi-drug resistance of cancer cells.<br/>I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy for the study of conformational states of an ABC model system in vitro, and thus to observe directly how elementary transport steps are coordinated. This will open up a virtually unexplored biophysical research area and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC transporters. The key questions of this proposal are:<br/><br/>Aim 1: What is the mechanism of substrate binding in ABC transporters? The conformational equilibrium (open vs. closed state) of ABC-associated substrate-binding proteins will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism of binding, i.e. induced fit vs. conformational selection.<br/><br/>Aim 2: What are relevant conformational states and changes for substrate translocation? The time- and length-scales of conformational changes in transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains as well as interactions with other domains will be characterized using the osmoregulator OpuA as a model system.<br/><br/>Aim 3: How are substrate binding, energy utilization and translocation coordinated in ABC transporters? Finally, a complete model of transport will be developed to decipher the coordination of transport events, i.e. how substrate binding and ATP-hydrolysis are coupled and transferred into conformational changes that drive substrate transport.",

However, elastic dislocation theory combined with friction laws suggests that fluid overpressure may inhibit the dynamic instabilities that result in earthquakes. This controversy poses a serious problem in our understanding of earthquake physics, with severe implications for both natural and human-induced seismic hazard. Nevertheless, currently, there are only a few systematic studies of the role of fluid pressure under controlled, laboratory conditions for which the evolution of friction parameters and slip stability can be deduced. Here I propose a comprehensive experimental study of The role of Fluid pressure in EArthquake Triggering (FEAT). The proposed work will document the evolution of fault friction parameters as a function of fluid overpressure using a world-class rock deformation apparatus. The laboratory experiments will build on the characterization of fault zone structure, fluid flow, and deformation processes, which I intend to reconstruct from careful field evaluations of ancient faults that represent exhumed analogues of seismically active structures.

NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

    "project_objective": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with a prevalence of 1.5-2% in European populations. By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

    "project_objective": "Animals harbor specialized bacterial communities in their guts, typically referred to as gut microbiomes. Despite the importance of gut microbiomes for host health, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. There is evidence that the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome has emerged through the diversification of a few founder lineages. However, how lineages have diversified into discrete species and which underlying mechanisms maintain the diversity in the gut remains elusive. The current project will address these questions by studying the gut microbiome of honey bees. We have recently found that the eight dominant bacterial lineages in the honey bee gut have substantially diversified, which is a striking parallelism to the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome. Moreover, we have established experiments to colonize microbiota-free bees with cultured isolates of divergent bee gut bacteria. This provides us with unique opportunities to study bacterial evolution in the gut in a simple and experimentally amenable system. The project is divided into four work packages addressing interconnected research questions of current biology: We will (i) determine the population genomic landscape of divergent gut bacteria, (ii) investigate whether bacterial diversification has resulted in competition or cooperation, (iii) discover novel mechanisms of bacterial interactions, and (iv) reveal how bacterial diversification impacts the symbiosis with the host. To this end, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining comparative metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, bee colonization experiments, microscopy, bacterial genetics, and automated bee tracking. This project situated at the forefront of microbial symbiosis will provide groundbreaking insights into microbial evolution and ecology, gut microbiology, and honey bee health and biology.",

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

Strategies to generate required tissues using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are associated with either ethical or medical safety issues. An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates.

Despite the importance of gut microbiomes for host health, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. There is evidence that the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome has emerged through the diversification of a few founder lineages. However, how lineages have diversified into discrete species and which underlying mechanisms maintain the diversity in the gut remains elusive. The current project will address these questions by studying the gut microbiome of honey bees. We have recently found that the eight dominant bacterial lineages in the honey bee gut have substantially diversified, which is a striking parallelism to the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome. Moreover, we have established experiments to colonize microbiota-free bees with cultured isolates of divergent bee gut bacteria. This provides us with unique opportunities to study bacterial evolution in the gut in a simple and experimentally amenable system. The project is divided into four work packages addressing interconnected research questions of current biology: We will (i) determine the population genomic landscape of divergent gut bacteria, (ii) investigate whether bacterial diversification has resulted in competition or cooperation, (iii) discover novel mechanisms of bacterial interactions, and (iv) reveal how bacterial diversification impacts the symbiosis with the host. To this end, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining comparative metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, bee colonization experiments, microscopy, bacterial genetics, and automated bee tracking.

To accomplish these bold goals we shall develop novel multiplexed methodologies enabling unprecedented scale of construction and phenotypic testing of identified mutations. While genetic epistasis is considered of key importance to resistance evolution most studies focus on mutations within an individual gene. Through the development of a novel experimental approach we shall elucidate complex epistatic interaction networks between mutations accumulated during resistance evolution. <br/><br/>Finally, we will conduct mechanistic studies to uncover the mechanisms of collateral sensitivity. These studies will shed light on this underappreciated phenomenon, which is of critical relevance to drug discovery and the evolution of drug resistance.

The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present, AAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on effectiveness in small animal models. We (and others) have shown substantial progress in improving gene therapy for eye diseases in rodents. However, small animal studies are not often predictive of human outcome when it comes to the efficacy of viral delivery. Moreover, non-human primates used as pre-clinical animal models do not display any pathology making them unsuitable for testing efficacy. Here, I propose to overcome these bottlenecks in translational gene therapy by generating non-human primate models of retinal degeneration where effects of therapies and prosthesis on sight restoration can be tested. Generating transgenic primates using germline transgenesis would be very costly and ethically problematic. I thus propose to induce retinal disease locally, following delivery of pathogenic genes within specific subsets of cells in the non-human primate retina (Aim A). In Aim B, I propose to develop novel AAVs for use in human gene therapy using directed evolution. This bioengineering approach has yielded AAVs with enhanced delivery properties in the murine retina and applying it to post-mortem human retinas will generate AAVs responding to a clinical need in gene therapy. All together, the creation of models of disease in primates combined with novel AAVs tested in human post-mortem retinas will enable us to validate therapies aiming at vision restoration and neuroprotection in retinas with a macula and high central visual acuity, removing a major roadblock in the development of ocular therapeutics for humans.",

It is paramount to identify safe operating spaces for humanity and the planet in terms of these critical forcing levels, in order to prevent harmful transitions to alternative, undesirable states of the Earth system. The mechanisms leading to such abrupt transitions are only partly understood, and further research in this regard is urgently needed. State-of-art Earth System Models appear to respond too smoothly at TPs and have difficulties in simulating abrupt transitions that occurred in the planet\u2019s history.   TiPES will address these problems from several angles: 1. The project will identify subsystems that may exhibit abrupt transitions, and couplings between them, by focussing on paleoclimatic records and abrupt transitions therein. Novel methods to detect Early Warning Signals of forthcoming TPs, and to make skilful predictions on their basis, will be developed. 2. The potential shortcomings of models in representing TPs will be evaluated; in particular, TiPES will investigate how Bayesian calibration techniques can help enable these models to simulate past abrupt transitions.  3. TiPES will develop a generalized theory of climate sensitivity that accounts for the presence of TPs and feedbacks across various time scales.  4. To define safe operating spaces. TiPES will focus on dynamical system theory and on global stability notions for non-autonomous systems in order to estimate the stability of desirable states.  5. The results obtained by the project will be communicated to policy makers in a manner that facilitates decisions and their implementation. TiPES will develop formal approaches to define the socioeconomic risks of crossing TPs, and to derive decision strategies to keep anthropogenic forcing below levels where abrupt transitions may occur.",

A new evidence-based framework to assess the viability, challenges and governance implications of decarbonisation pathways will be developed and tools provided. It builds on the integration of conceptual work, empirical mapping and case-studies of innovations and climate initiatives, co-creation of knowledge and co-design of pathways, and careful assessment of the implications for other societal goals. The approach is to study and understand transitions and emerging initiatives from within sectoral contexts where government climate policy is only one of many factors that shape perceptions and strategies. As a result, REINVENT supports systemic innovation and system-wide transformation in the studied sectors.  The project provides stakeholders with access to leading research and analytical capacity concerning key dimensions of low carbon transitions; it is also a platform for dialogue and learning about feasible pathways so that policies can be better aligned with the specific needs and conditions in different sectors. REINVENT will make an innovative scientific and societal contribution through (a) focusing on important economic sectors that are relatively unexplored yet important for the whole economy, (b) studying transitions from within these sectors, and (c) taking whole value chains into account through (d) a new analytical approach capable of advancing our understanding of key drivers, dynamics and implications of decarbonisation.",

However, elastic dislocation theory combined with friction laws suggests that fluid overpressure may inhibit the dynamic instabilities that result in earthquakes. This controversy poses a serious problem in our understanding of earthquake physics, with severe implications for both natural and human-induced seismic hazard. Nevertheless, currently, there are only a few systematic studies of the role of fluid pressure under controlled, laboratory conditions for which the evolution of friction parameters and slip stability can be deduced. Here I propose a comprehensive experimental study of The role of Fluid pressure in EArthquake Triggering (FEAT). The proposed work will document the evolution of fault friction parameters as a function of fluid overpressure using a world-class rock deformation apparatus. The laboratory experiments will build on the characterization of fault zone structure, fluid flow, and deformation processes, which I intend to reconstruct from careful field evaluations of ancient faults that represent exhumed analogues of seismically active structures. An important part of my work will be the interaction with the energy industry to investigate the role of fluids in induced seismicity. <br/>The experimental work will strengthen my expertise in frictional and fluid flow characterisation of fault rocks. Additionally, I will develop new skills in electronic and mechanical engineering aspects of experiments. Field and microstructural work will widen my background in the field of structural geology, microstructural analysis and model construction using energy-industry software. These training-through-research activities will allow for the creation of unprecedented insight into the role of fluid pressure in earthquake triggering while broadening my competences via interdisciplinary studies and inter-sectorial experience.",

As adherent cells also read their environment through substrate interactions there is a great interest in developing such substrates in a predictable manner. Their first point of contact is through their focal adhesions and it is also though them that forces are applied allowing the cell to migrate and establish cytoskeletal tension which in turn regulates cell function. The objective of this project is to investigate the cell-substrate interaction at the nanoscale and correlate that to the surface topography for predictable biomaterials. Through the application of state-of-the-art nanofabrication we will fabricate precise surface topographies with length scales comparable to the structural units found in the focal adhesions. The aim is to map and understand the topographical influence in the architectural arrangement of the proteins in the adhesions. Aided by high resolution microscopy we will classify cell types on different nanotopographies. Combining that information with machine learning, we will be able to gain information about cell characteristics from the rule set. That information can also be used in reverse to identify cell types with the previously defined characteristic. This approach is similar to face recognition seen on cameras and mobile phones.<br/> <br/>The proposed research project will not only provide insight to an area of biomaterials not previously explored, yet aim to provide a blueprint for future design of biomaterials.",

This capability will deliver innovative climate science and a new generation of advanced Earth System Models. Sector-specific end-users in policy and business will be identified and engaged individually, with iterative feedback, to ensure that new climate information is tailored, actionable and strengthening societal risk management decisions.<br/>These goals will be achieved through the development of coupled GCMs from seven groups across Europe, with sufficient resolution to reproduce realistic weather and climate features (~25km mesh size), in addition to enhanced process parameterisation. Thorough assessment will use innovative process-based metrics and the latest observational and reanalysis datasets. Targeted experimental design will reduce inter-model spread and produce robust projections, forming the European contribution to the CMIP6 High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, led by PRIMAVERA. <br/>It is the first time that high-resolution coupled GCMs will be used under a single experimental protocol. Coordination, and the underlying process-understanding, will significantly increase the robustness of our findings. Our new capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the drivers of variability and change in European climate, including extremes, since such regional changes continue to be characterised by high uncertainty. <br/>We will also explore the frontiers of climate modelling and of high performance computing to produce simulations with a reduced reliance on physical parameterisations. These will explicitly resolve key processes such as ocean eddies, and will include new stochastic parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes.

Measuring the effectiveness of GHG emission reduction policies against agreed-upon international targets require accurate and precise estimates of emissions and their trends. These estimates need to be established and regularly updated using transparent methods, tracable to international standards. VERIFY proposes to quantify more accurately carbon stocks and the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) across the EU based on independent observations in support of inventories that rely only on statistical data.  The same approach will also be tested for US, China and Indonesia, in collaboration with foreign partnes. Accurate characterization of the space-time variations of GHG fluxes, separating their anthropogenic and natural components and their drivers, will be based on advanced modelling approaches using atmospheric GHG measurements, tracer transport inversions and various arrays of land observations, in-situ and from space. The improved knowledge of GHG budgets from VERIFY will be used to improve national inventories, in collaboration with national inventory agencies, and to deliver policy-relevant information to track progress of the EU mitigation efforts to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement on Climate, in line with international cooperation mechanisms promoted by the WMO, the IPCC and the UNFCCC.",

This challenging target is aligned with the European Commission\u2019s stepwise approach for a requirement-driven integration of Earth observations, from remote sensing and in situ, with enhanced modelling capabilities for CO2 fossil fuel emissions, along with other natural and anthropogenic CO2 emissions and transport. The project will pursue a consolidated methodology for integrating the monitoring system components, as well as innovation for estimating fossil fuel CO2 fluxes. These include reconciling bottom-up and top-down constraints and handling systematic errors of satellite sensors. Earth observations from satellites will be combined with in situ CO2 observations and information from co-emitters or isotopes to support the attribution of fossil fuel emissions and uncertainty reduction. Methodological advances will include a representation of anthropogenic CO2 variability in space and time, responding to documented shortcomings and needs, and a carbon cycle data assimilation system extended to enable estimates of emission uncertainties. Strategies to separate anthropogenic CO2 emissions from biogenic fluxes at country to global scales using observations and models will be documented. CHE will support a large community by providing a library of realistic CO2 simulations from global to city scale to examine the capacity for monitoring future fossil fuel emissions and to adequately dimension space mission requirements. Community building will include direct collaboration across 22 European institutions, and communication and liaison with key European and international stakeholders. These coordination efforts will ensure the transfer of science and technology requirements and recommendations for strengthening existing assets with a view to developing an anthropogenic CO2 monitoring service.",

A major challenge for climate change science is to develop an understanding of the sensitivity of organisms to the changing environment, and try and find spatial, broad taxonomic or trait based generalities that will enable more accurate identification of regions and ecosystems at severe risk of climate change impacts (sensitivity hotspots) so that mitigation and adaptive management actions can be prioritised. There are, however, several challenges associated with predicting sensitivity hotspots. At the forefront of these challenges is our understanding of the drivers of organism\u2019s thermal tolerance thresholds, and the proximity of temperature thresholds to the local climate extremes and climate change projections, herein called thermal safety margin (TSM). This project merges concepts from physiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, biogeography and physical oceanography into an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that exposes inconsistencies among current paradigms and fundamental limitations to our understanding of the sensitivity of marine organisms to climate change. The conceptual framework presented here offers a testable, interdisciplinary model to address this knowledge gap. Specifically we ask the questions 1) How do patterns in thermal tolerance breadth and thermal safety margins vary throughout species\u2019 geographical ranges? And 2) What are the environmental drivers, biotic traits and evolutionary factors that determine an organisms thermal tolerance? Through identifying the nature of thermal tolerance patterns and identifying some of the mechanisms influencing these patterns, this research aims to increase the accuracy and resolution of predictions of the sensitivity of marine biota to climate change.",

Understanding these feedback processes is a huge intellectual challenge. In part because of the pioneering work of the PI (Cox et al., 2000), many of the climate projections reported in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) now include climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. However the latest Earth System Models (ESMs) continue to show a huge range in the projected responses of the land carbon cycle over the 21st century. This uncertainty threatens to undermine the value of these projections to inform climate policy.  This project (ECCLES) is designed to produce significant reductions in the uncertainties associated with land-climate interactions, using the novel concept of Emergent Constraints - relationships between future projections and observable variations in the current Earth System that are common across the ensemble of ESMs. Emergent Constraints have many attractive features but chief amongst these is that they can make ensembles of ESMs more than the sum of the parts - allowing the full range of ESM projections to be used collectively, alongside key observations, to reduce uncertainties in the future climate. The project will deliver: (i) a theoretical foundation for Emergent Constraints; (ii) new datasets on the changing function of the land biosphere; (iii) Emergent Constraints on land-climate interactions based on observed temporal and spatial variations; (iv) a new generation of scientists expert in land-climate interactions and Emergent Constraints. ECCLES will benefit from the expertise and experience of the PI, which includes training as a theoretical physicist, an early career developing models of the land biosphere for ESMs, and a current career in a department of mathematics where he is at the forefront of efforts to develop and apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (Cox et al., 2013, Wenzel et al., 2016).",

Consensus criteria currently applied for the selection of patients for heart transplantation (HTx) leave an inconvenient margin of uncertainty, because of the unpredictable course of the disease and the shortage of donor hearts. Furthermore, monitoring graft function and adjusting immunosuppression remain major challenges after HTx. Endomyocardial biopsies, up to 20 in the first year after HTx, are the standard approach to detect graft rejection, but require an invasive risk-carrying procedure. uPROPHET aims to develop UP profiling: (1) as a prognostic tool helpful in selecting terminally ill heart failure patients for HTx with the greatest probability of survival while adding a maximum of high-quality years to life; and (2) as an instrument to monitor graft performance and immune system activity and to manage immunosuppression. The new UP classifiers will be initially validated by demonstrating analogy between the proteomic profiles in urine and tissue samples of explanted hearts. uPROPHET will show case the translation of state-of-the-art technology into \u201cinnovative services\u201d, broaden the indications for UP, and therefore have a major impact on the plans of the business partner measuring the UP profiles. The evident benefit for the customer (patient) is the early and non-invasive stratification of risk in heart failure patients before and after HTx, hence allowing an early, personalised, and targeted approach. Clinical implementation of uPROPHET findings will bring European research to the forefront of the highly competitive fields of biomarker research and personalised medicine and impact on transplantation medicine beyond HTx.",

AML has a dismal survival rate of <30% with novel targeted therapies urgently required. My research focuses on improving our understanding of the biology of AML and using this knowledge to develop targeted therapies to improve outcomes. Recently loss-of-function mutations in members of the cohesin complex have been described in up to 15% of patients with AML. The cohesin complex mediates sister chromatid cohesion, an important process for DNA repair and proper chromosomal segregation. It has also recently been demonstrated to be important for transcriptional regulation, due to its coordination of communication between promoters and enhancer and insulator elements. Evidence suggests that transcriptional alterations underlie the mechanisms of transformation by cohesin mutations in AML. However, other evidence and my preliminary data also suggest cohesin mutant cells to have specific vulnerabilities related to their roles in proper chromosome segregation and DNA repair that can be specifically targeted.<br/><br/>Objectives:<br/><br/>1) Generation of mouse models of cohesin-mutated AML.

The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present, AAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on effectiveness in small animal models. We (and others) have shown substantial progress in improving gene therapy for eye diseases in rodents. However, small animal studies are not often predictive of human outcome when it comes to the efficacy of viral delivery. Moreover, non-human primates used as pre-clinical animal models do not display any pathology making them unsuitable for testing efficacy. Here, I propose to overcome these bottlenecks in translational gene therapy by generating non-human primate models of retinal degeneration where effects of therapies and prosthesis on sight restoration can be tested. Generating transgenic primates using germline transgenesis would be very costly and ethically problematic. I thus propose to induce retinal disease locally, following delivery of pathogenic genes within specific subsets of cells in the non-human primate retina (Aim A). In Aim B, I propose to develop novel AAVs for use in human gene therapy using directed evolution. This bioengineering approach has yielded AAVs with enhanced delivery properties in the murine retina and applying it to post-mortem human retinas will generate AAVs responding to a clinical need in gene therapy. All together, the creation of models of disease in primates combined with novel AAVs tested in human post-mortem retinas will enable us to validate therapies aiming at vision restoration and neuroprotection in retinas with a macula and high central visual acuity, removing a major roadblock in the development of ocular therapeutics for humans.",

Despite their importance, all proposed molecular models for transport are based on indirect evidence due to the inability of classical biophysical and biochemical techniques to directly visualize dynamic structural changes. To solve this problem, I suggest a novel approach that can decipher the molecular mechanisms of transport, with the ultimate goal to use this knowledge against pathogenic bacteria, for treatment of ABC-related diseases or multi-drug resistance of cancer cells.<br/>I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy for the study of conformational states of an ABC model system in vitro, and thus to observe directly how elementary transport steps are coordinated. This will open up a virtually unexplored biophysical research area and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC transporters. The key questions of this proposal are:<br/><br/>Aim 1: What is the mechanism of substrate binding in ABC transporters? The conformational equilibrium (open vs. closed state) of ABC-associated substrate-binding proteins will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism of binding, i.e. induced fit vs. conformational selection.<br/><br/>Aim 2: What are relevant conformational states and changes for substrate translocation? The time- and length-scales of conformational changes in transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains as well as interactions with other domains will be characterized using the osmoregulator OpuA as a model system.<br/><br/>Aim 3: How are substrate binding, energy utilization and translocation coordinated in ABC transporters? Finally, a complete model of transport will be developed to decipher the coordination of transport events, i.e. how substrate binding and ATP-hydrolysis are coupled and transferred into conformational changes that drive substrate transport.",

In tandem, we will develop imaging strategies that focus on robustness and work well in living systems, in exchange for a spatial resolution of a 50 to 70 nm and a temporal resolution of a few seconds or less. <br/>We will use these developments in the study of the nanoscale spatiotemporal regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor (GCPR) signalling in living systems.

Intriguingly, many, if not most, cellular compartments are not membrane enclosed. Rather, they assemble dynamically by phase separation, typically triggered upon a specific event. Despite significant progress on reconstituting such liquid-like assemblies in vitro, we lack information as to whether these compartments in vivo are indeed amorphous liquids, or whether they exhibit structural features such as gels or fibers.

We will combine these studies with a quantitative description of the crowded nature of cytoplasm and of its local variations, to provide a direct readout of the impact of excluded volume on molecular assembly in living cells.

As adherent cells also read their environment through substrate interactions there is a great interest in developing such substrates in a predictable manner.

The objective of this project is to investigate the cell-substrate interaction at the nanoscale and correlate that to the surface topography for predictable biomaterials. Through the application of state-of-the-art nanofabrication we will fabricate precise surface topographies with length scales comparable to the structural units found in the focal adhesions. The aim is to map and understand the topographical influence in the architectural arrangement of the proteins in the adhesions. Aided by high resolution microscopy we will classify cell types on different nanotopographies. Combining that information with machine learning, we will be able to gain information about cell characteristics from the rule set. That information can also be used in reverse to identify cell types with the previously defined characteristic. This approach is similar to face recognition seen on cameras and mobile phones.<br/> <br/>The proposed research project will not only provide insight to an area of biomaterials not previously explored, yet aim to provide a blueprint for future design of biomaterials.",

    "project_objective": "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease in the aging population of Europe. NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

    "project_objective": "Fluorescence microscopy is the tool of choice for live-cell imaging. Its usefulness has been further enhanced by the availability of genetically-encoded biosensors, which enable the visualisation of when and where a certain activity arises. In addition, the development of diffraction-unlimited imaging has dramatically improved the spatial resolution of fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques have had difficulty working with biosensors, largely limiting the information to the spatial location of the labels. <br/>This project seeks to develop diffraction-unlimited imaging of biosensors, creating activity maps with a diffraction-unlimited spatial resolution in living systems. I propose to meet this challenge using a two-pronged approach, focusing both on the development of labels and sensors as well as new imaging tools and strategies. Based on existing scaffolds, we will develop sensors that display strong photochromism, providing reversible fluorescence dynamics intrinsically suited to superresolution imaging. In tandem, we will develop imaging strategies that focus on robustness and work well in living systems, in exchange for a spatial resolution of a 50 to 70 nm and a temporal resolution of a few seconds or less. <br/>We will use these developments in the study of the nanoscale spatiotemporal regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor (GCPR) signalling in living systems. By extending sub-diffraction imaging to the molecular environment, this project will contribute new insights into long-standing research questions that directly involve the health and well-being of all of us, while also enabling exciting prospects for further research.",

So far, nanostructures are either chemically synthesized or produced using top-down approaches such as nanolithography, but no processes exist to take a few nanostructures and perform the basic operations required to assemble them into a more complex system. This proposal aims at addressing this need by realizing at the nanoscale the different functions that are required for a production line: receiving and moving raw nanomaterial in position, where it can be immobilized and worked on or transformed; combining different elements into more complex systems that support new functionalities. The project uses optical forces generated by plasmonic traps as enabling mechanism to act on raw material and the entire production line will be integrated into microfluidics, which will perform as an advanced conveyor belt. Local electrophoresis and photo-curable polymerization are used to locally modify and assemble raw nanoparticles. In addition to implementing challenging nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale electric contacts and perforated membranes, this project will also explore a fair amount of completely new physics, including the van der Waals interaction \u2013 which will be studied numerically and experimentally \u2013 the competition between optical and chemical forces or electrostatic attraction, and the detailed determination of the trapping potential produced by plasmonic nanostructures. The foreseen research is very comprehensive, including modelling, nanofabrication and explorations at the nanoscale. This ground-braking proposal will demonstrate how additive manufacturing can be implemented at the nanoscale.",

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

    "project_objective": "Alcohol overuse is an important societal challenge with annual healthcare costs of over \u20ac22 billion in Europe. Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

Consensus criteria currently applied for the selection of patients for heart transplantation (HTx) leave an inconvenient margin of uncertainty, because of the unpredictable course of the disease and the shortage of donor hearts. Furthermore, monitoring graft function and adjusting immunosuppression remain major challenges after HTx. Endomyocardial biopsies, up to 20 in the first year after HTx, are the standard approach to detect graft rejection, but require an invasive risk-carrying procedure. uPROPHET aims to develop UP profiling: (1) as a prognostic tool helpful in selecting terminally ill heart failure patients for HTx with the greatest probability of survival while adding a maximum of high-quality years to life; and (2) as an instrument to monitor graft performance and immune system activity and to manage immunosuppression. The new UP classifiers will be initially validated by demonstrating analogy between the proteomic profiles in urine and tissue samples of explanted hearts. uPROPHET will show case the translation of state-of-the-art technology into \u201cinnovative services\u201d, broaden the indications for UP, and therefore have a major impact on the plans of the business partner measuring the UP profiles. The evident benefit for the customer (patient) is the early and non-invasive stratification of risk in heart failure patients before and after HTx, hence allowing an early, personalised, and targeted approach. Clinical implementation of uPROPHET findings will bring European research to the forefront of the highly competitive fields of biomarker research and personalised medicine and impact on transplantation medicine beyond HTx.",

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease.

    "project_objective": "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease in the aging population of Europe. NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

Exploring this big health data promises to reveal new insights into disease mechanisms and therapy outcomes. Ultimately, the goal is to exploit these insights for Precision Medicine, which hopes to offer personalized preventive care and therapy selection for each patient. <br/>A technology with transformational potential in analysing this health data is Machine Learning. Machine Learning strives to discover new knowledge in form of statistical dependencies in large datasets. Mining health data is, however, not a simple direct application of established machine learning techniques. On the contrary, the emerging population-scale and ultra-high dimensionality of health data creates the need to develop Machine Learning algorithms that can successfully operate at this scale. Overcoming these frontiers in Machine Learning is key to making the vision of Precision Medicine a reality.<br/>To meet this challenge, Europe urgently needs a new generation of scientists with knowledge in both machine learning and in health data analysis, who are extremely rare at a global scale. Our ETN\u2019s goal is to close this gap, by bringing together leading European research institutes in Machine Learning and Statistical Genetics, both from the private and public sector, to train 14 early stage researchers.

    "project_objective": "There is rising concern that several subsystems of the Earth may respond highly nonlinearly at critical future levels of anthropogenic forcing; these levels have recently been associated with tipping points (TPs). It is paramount to identify safe operating spaces for humanity and the planet in terms of these critical forcing levels, in order to prevent harmful transitions to alternative, undesirable states of the Earth system. The mechanisms leading to such abrupt transitions are only partly understood, and further research in this regard is urgently needed. State-of-art Earth System Models appear to respond too smoothly at TPs and have difficulties in simulating abrupt transitions that occurred in the planet\u2019s history.   TiPES will address these problems from several angles: 1. The project will identify subsystems that may exhibit abrupt transitions, and couplings between them, by focussing on paleoclimatic records and abrupt transitions therein. Novel methods to detect Early Warning Signals of forthcoming TPs, and to make skilful predictions on their basis, will be developed. 2. The potential shortcomings of models in representing TPs will be evaluated; in particular, TiPES will investigate how Bayesian calibration techniques can help enable these models to simulate past abrupt transitions.  3. TiPES will develop a generalized theory of climate sensitivity that accounts for the presence of TPs and feedbacks across various time scales.  4. To define safe operating spaces. TiPES will focus on dynamical system theory and on global stability notions for non-autonomous systems in order to estimate the stability of desirable states.  5. The results obtained by the project will be communicated to policy makers in a manner that facilitates decisions and their implementation. TiPES will develop formal approaches to define the socioeconomic risks of crossing TPs, and to derive decision strategies to keep anthropogenic forcing below levels where abrupt transitions may occur.",

We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease.

However, elastic dislocation theory combined with friction laws suggests that fluid overpressure may inhibit the dynamic instabilities that result in earthquakes. This controversy poses a serious problem in our understanding of earthquake physics, with severe implications for both natural and human-induced seismic hazard.

The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

As such, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and effective prevention and treatment strategies. As numerous clinical trials have shown, lifestyle modification is by far the best way to prevent these diseases, with lifestyle being twice as effective as the best drugs, less costly and free from side effects. Yet, human biology is complex, causing some people to respond well and others poorly to the same lifestyle interventions. Thus, a huge, as yet unrealised opportunity exists to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases by tailoring lifestyle interventions to the patient\u2019s unique biology. <br/>NASCENT is an integrated programme of research through which I will functionally annotate and later translate discoveries of gene-lifestyle interactions made through the interrogation of large epidemiological (N>100,000) datasets at my disposal. The functional annotation of these discoveries will be done using state-of-the-art epigenomic and targeted gene editing tools, whereas the translation of those findings will be achieved using a innovative and powerful clinical trial design that focuses on treatments that are tailored to the participant\u2019s genotype (genotype-based recall). <br/>NASCENT capitalizes on a solid foundation of cohorts, methods, and expertise that I have built-up over the past fifteen years, but also exploits state-of-the-art epigenomic and gene-editing technologies that have not previously been used in studies of gene-lifestyle interactions. I expect the integration of these established and new approaches in NASCENT to propel major advances in understanding gene-lifestyle interactions in cardiometabolic disease that help optimise disease prevention.",

    "project_objective": "Fluorescence microscopy is the tool of choice for live-cell imaging. Its usefulness has been further enhanced by the availability of genetically-encoded biosensors, which enable the visualisation of when and where a certain activity arises. In addition, the development of diffraction-unlimited imaging has dramatically improved the spatial resolution of fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques have had difficulty working with biosensors, largely limiting the information to the spatial location of the labels. <br/>This project seeks to develop diffraction-unlimited imaging of biosensors, creating activity maps with a diffraction-unlimited spatial resolution in living systems. I propose to meet this challenge using a two-pronged approach, focusing both on the development of labels and sensors as well as new imaging tools and strategies. Based on existing scaffolds, we will develop sensors that display strong photochromism, providing reversible fluorescence dynamics intrinsically suited to superresolution imaging. In tandem, we will develop imaging strategies that focus on robustness and work well in living systems, in exchange for a spatial resolution of a 50 to 70 nm and a temporal resolution of a few seconds or less. <br/>We will use these developments in the study of the nanoscale spatiotemporal regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor (GCPR) signalling in living systems. By extending sub-diffraction imaging to the molecular environment, this project will contribute new insights into long-standing research questions that directly involve the health and well-being of all of us, while also enabling exciting prospects for further research.",

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

Its usefulness has been further enhanced by the availability of genetically-encoded biosensors, which enable the visualisation of when and where a certain activity arises. In addition, the development of diffraction-unlimited imaging has dramatically improved the spatial resolution of fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques have had difficulty working with biosensors, largely limiting the information to the spatial location of the labels. <br/>This project seeks to develop diffraction-unlimited imaging of biosensors, creating activity maps with a diffraction-unlimited spatial resolution in living systems. I propose to meet this challenge using a two-pronged approach, focusing both on the development of labels and sensors as well as new imaging tools and strategies. Based on existing scaffolds, we will develop sensors that display strong photochromism, providing reversible fluorescence dynamics intrinsically suited to superresolution imaging. In tandem, we will develop imaging strategies that focus on robustness and work well in living systems, in exchange for a spatial resolution of a 50 to 70 nm and a temporal resolution of a few seconds or less. <br/>We will use these developments in the study of the nanoscale spatiotemporal regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor (GCPR) signalling in living systems. By extending sub-diffraction imaging to the molecular environment, this project will contribute new insights into long-standing research questions that directly involve the health and well-being of all of us, while also enabling exciting prospects for further research.",

In order to secure a widespread application of these reactions in organic synthesis and in order to make the respective products available for high-tech applications, it is required that photochemical reactions can be performed enantioselectively, i.e. that the three-dimensional architecture of the product molecules is unambiguously defined. Despite some progress in recent years, this challenge has as yet remained unsolved. It is the objective of this proposal to develop catalytic methods that allow the enantioselective synthesis of a broad variety of compound classes by light-induced reactions. The mode of action of potential catalysts is based on energy transfer or on wavelength-selective excitation. In the former scenario, the substrate-catalyst complex will be held together by non-covalent interactions, which position the substrate for an efficient energy transfer and for an enantioselective approach of the reagent. In the latter approach, acid-base interactions in the substrate-catalyst complex will lead to a significant bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate, enabling a selective excitation within the complex and a subsequent enantioselective reaction pathway within a spatially defined chiral environment. Both approaches include the option to employ sunlight as the exclusive energy source to drive enantioselective processes without the need to apply external heat or pressure.",

    "project_objective": "The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains makes tuberculosis (TB) a key priority for infectious disease research. Inflammation and autophagy are two fundamental processes critical to TB pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence shows that TB disease is worsened by deregulation of the inflammatory response. On the other hand, autophagy has recently emerged as a crucial host defence mechanism. Autophagy counteracts the ability of mycobacteria to survive inside host cells and targets them for degradation. Autophagy is also thought to control the inflammatory response. However, the interaction between inflammation and autophagy in host defence against TB remains unclear. The aim of my proposal is to use the well-established zebrafish model of TB to gain insight into this key question. Recently, the host laboratory discovered that the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM1) protects against TB in the zebrafish model. They also implicated this important autophagy regulator in inflammation, as it strongly affects expression of interleukin-1beta (IL1B). I have specific expertise in studying IL1B-mediated inflammation in zebrafish. Thus the proposed project will be a great synergy between me and the host laboratory, which is leading in zebrafish infectious disease research. I will determine how modulation of autophagy or manipulation of IL1B levels reciprocally influence each other during TB disease. The zebrafish model provides excellent tools to visualize these processes in vivo. Furthermore, I will take advantage of the host\u2019s expertise in RNA sequencing and proteomics to study genome-wide effects of autophagy modulation on the inflammatory response. A secondment will allow me to compare results in the TB model with a damage-induced inflammation model. The project will provide new insights into regulatory pathways that could potentially be intervened in treatment of TB or other inflammatory diseases with common characteristics.",

Three related user communities lie at the heart of the CoE: academic, industrial and clinical researchers who all wish to build, develop and extend such capabilities in line with the increasing power of high performance computers. Three distinct exemplar research areas will be pursued: cardiovascular, molecularly-based and neuro-musculoskeletal medicine.<br/> <br/>Predictive computational biomedicine involves applications that are comprised of multiple components, arranged as far as possible into automated workflows in which data is taken, from an individual patient, processed, and combined into a model which produces predicted health outcomes. Many of the models are multiscale, requiring the coupling of two or more high performance codes. Computational biomedicine holds out the prospect of predicting the effect of personalised medical treatments and interventions ahead of carrying them out, with all the ensuing benefits. Indeed, in some cases, it is already doing so today.<br/> <br/>The CoE presents a powerful consortium of partners and has an outward facing nature and will actively train, disseminate and engage with these user communities across Europe and beyond. Because this field is new and growing rapidly, it offers numerous innovative opportunities. There are three SMEs and three enterprises within the project, as well as eight associate partners drawn from across the biomedical sector, who are fully aware of the vast potential of HPC in this domain. We shall work with them to advance the exploitation of HPC and will engage closely with medical professionals through our partner hospitals in order to establish modeling and simulation as an integral part of clinical decision making. Our CoE is thus user-driven, integrated, multidisciplinary, and distributed; presenting a vision that is in line with the Work Programme.",

    "project_objective": "Alcohol overuse is an important societal challenge with annual healthcare costs of over \u20ac22 billion in Europe. Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

In the latter approach, acid-base interactions in the substrate-catalyst complex will lead to a significant bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate, enabling a selective excitation within the complex and a subsequent enantioselective reaction pathway within a spatially defined chiral environment. Both approaches include the option to employ sunlight as the exclusive energy source to drive enantioselective processes without the need to apply external heat or pressure.",

    "project_objective": "Applied electrochemistry plays a key role in many technologies, such as batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors or solar cells. It is therefore at the core of many research programs all over the world. Yet, fundamental electrochemical investigations remain scarce. In particular, electrochemistry is among the fields for which the gap between theory and experiment is the largest. From the computational point of view, there is no molecular dynamics (MD) software devoted to the simulation of electrochemical systems while other fields such as biochemistry (GROMACS) or material science (LAMMPS) have dedicated tools. This is due to the difficulty of accounting for complex effects arising from (i) the degree of metallicity of the electrode (i.e. from semimetals to perfect conductors), (ii) the mutual polarization occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface and (iii) the redox reactivity through explicit electron transfers. Current understanding therefore relies on standard theories that derive from an inaccurate molecular-scale picture. My objective is to fill this gap by introducing a whole set of new methods for simulating electrochemical systems. They will be provided to the computational electrochemistry community as a cutting-edge MD software adapted to supercomputers. First applications will aim at the discovery of new electrolytes for energy storage. Here I will focus on (1) \u2018\u2018water-in-salts\u2019\u2019 to understand why these revolutionary liquids enable much higher voltage than conventional solutions (2) redox reactions inside a nanoporous electrode to support the development of future capacitive energy storage devices. These selected applications are timely and rely on collaborations with leading experimental partners. The results are expected to shed an unprecedented light on the importance of polarization effects on the structure and the reactivity of electrode/electrolyte interfaces, establishing MD as a prominent tool for solving complex electrochemistry problems.",

    "project_objective": "There is rising concern that several subsystems of the Earth may respond highly nonlinearly at critical future levels of anthropogenic forcing; these levels have recently been associated with tipping points (TPs). It is paramount to identify safe operating spaces for humanity and the planet in terms of these critical forcing levels, in order to prevent harmful transitions to alternative, undesirable states of the Earth system. The mechanisms leading to such abrupt transitions are only partly understood, and further research in this regard is urgently needed. State-of-art Earth System Models appear to respond too smoothly at TPs and have difficulties in simulating abrupt transitions that occurred in the planet\u2019s history.   TiPES will address these problems from several angles: 1. The project will identify subsystems that may exhibit abrupt transitions, and couplings between them, by focussing on paleoclimatic records and abrupt transitions therein. Novel methods to detect Early Warning Signals of forthcoming TPs, and to make skilful predictions on their basis, will be developed. 2. The potential shortcomings of models in representing TPs will be evaluated; in particular, TiPES will investigate how Bayesian calibration techniques can help enable these models to simulate past abrupt transitions.  3. TiPES will develop a generalized theory of climate sensitivity that accounts for the presence of TPs and feedbacks across various time scales.  4. To define safe operating spaces. TiPES will focus on dynamical system theory and on global stability notions for non-autonomous systems in order to estimate the stability of desirable states.  5. The results obtained by the project will be communicated to policy makers in a manner that facilitates decisions and their implementation. TiPES will develop formal approaches to define the socioeconomic risks of crossing TPs, and to derive decision strategies to keep anthropogenic forcing below levels where abrupt transitions may occur.",

      "We have previously identified increased autoantibody levels toward the chloride-channel protein Anoctamin 2 (ANO2) in MS.",
      "Here, IgG antibody reactivity toward ANO2 and EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) was measured using bead-based multiplex serology in plasma samples from 8,746 MS cases and 7,228 controls.",
      "We detected increased anti-ANO2 antibody levels in MS (P = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221236) with 14.6% of cases and 7.8% of controls being ANO2 seropositive (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% confidence intervals [95%CI]: 1.5 to 1.8).",
      "The MS risk increase in ANO2-seropositive individuals was dramatic when also exposed to 3 known risk factors for MS: HLA-DRB1*15:01 carriage, absence of HLA-A*02:01, and high anti-EBNA1 antibody levels (OR = 24.9; 95%CI: 17.9 to 34.8).",
      "Reciprocal blocking experiments with ANO2 and EBNA1 peptides demonstrated antibody cross-reactivity, mapping to ANO2 [aa 140 to 149] and EBNA1 [aa 431 to 440].",
      "HLA gene region was associated with anti-ANO2 antibody levels and HLA-DRB1*04:01 haplotype was negatively associated with ANO2 seropositivity (OR = 0.6; 95%CI: 0.5 to 0.7).",
      "Anti-ANO2 antibody levels were not increased in patients from 3 other inflammatory disease cohorts.",
      "The HLA influence and the fact that specific IgG production usually needs T cell help provides indirect evidence for a T cell ANO2 autoreactivity in MS.",

In non-human primates, a single dose of VSV-ZEBOV elicited a strong (100%) and long-lasting protective efficacy against Ebola Zaire infections. Developed by Public Health Canada and manufactured by NewLink Genetics, VSV-ZEBOV was thus selected by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the 2 most promising vaccine candidates. To accelerate its clinical development, the WHO has organized a consortium and supported the organization of parallel first-in-man Phase I/II clinical trials, both in Europe and Africa. The primary objectives of these trials, initiated mid-November 2014, are to study the safety and antibody-inducing capacity of various doses of VSV-ZEBOV in European and African populations.<br/><br/>We propose to build upon this asset to acquire new and critical knowledge of the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited in humans by VSV-ZEBOV vaccination, with specific emphasis on trancriptomics and metabolomics signatures. To this aim, we have constructed a consortium including representatives from the vaccine manufacturer, scientists of the 3 main clinical sites (Switzerland, Gabon, Kenya) and world-leaders in immunology and partners of ADITEC, a large FP7- supported collaborative research programme aiming to accelerate the development of novel, powerful immunisation technologies for next-generation vaccines. We propose an ambitious program using cutting-edge technologies to perform an in depth characterization of the clinical samples harvested before/after VSV-ZEBOV immunization of 200 volunteers in Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya, and to extend the recently initiated clinical studies up to 12 months to identify the signatures and determinants of persistent immune responses.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

A fourth identified knowledge gap is the effective translation of new physical science understanding into an improved evidence base for policy decisions. CONSTRAIN will address this by developing climate model emulators that integrate and operationalise learning from across the consortium to provide new capability to assess impacts of climate change under a broad range of emission scenarios.

However, several key questions remain unanswered, including its mode of action, its correlation with protection and reactogenicity, the expected duration of protective efficacy and determinants of long-term responses, the influence of baseline immunity on vaccine \u201ctake\u201d, and the vaccine efficacy in children - a most vulnerable population. Following the interruption of the 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak, these questions, being central to the future licensing and use of VSV-ZEBOV, may not be addressed by collecting field data. The VSV-EBOPLUS project therefore proposes to use cutting-edge systems biology approaches to address these key questions, capitalizing on the unique availability of large series of extremely well defined samples from clinical vaccine studies with the VSV-ZEBOV vaccine in three different continents (Europe, Africa, US).<br/><br/>Specifically, the overarching objective of VSV-EBOPLUS is to comprehensively decipher the immune and molecular signatures of adult and pediatric responses elicited by VSV-ZEBOV through systems biology approaches. VSV-EBOPLUS will benefit from harmonized and standardized clinical trial protocols, in almost 1\u2019000 adults, adolescents and children.<br/>We propose:<br/>1) to examine early (days 0 to 7) blood samples from 512 adults injected with graded doses (from 3x103 to 1x108 pfu) of VSV-ZEBOV\u037e",

The need for predicting eco-evolutionary impacts of plastic and evolutionary responses to changing environments is still hampered by lack of strong experimental evidence. FluctEvol aims at shedding a new light on population responses to stochastic environments, and facilitating their prediction, using a unique combination of approaches. First, theoretical models of evolution and demography under a randomly changing optimum phenotype will be designed and analysed, producing new quantitative predictions. Second, statistical methodologies will be developed, and employed in meta-analyses of long-term datasets from natural populations. And third, large-scale and automated experimental evolution in stochastic environments will be carried out with the micro-alga Dunaliella salina, an extremophile that thrives at high and variable salinities. We will manipulate the magnitude and predictability of fluctuations in salinity, and use high-throughput phenotyping and candidate-gene sequencing to analyse the evolution of plasticity for traits involved in salinity adaptation in this species: glycerol and carotene content. We will thus combine the benefits of experimental evolution in microbes (short generations, ample replication) with a priori knowledge of ecologically relevant adaptive traits, allowing for hypothesis-driven experiments. The success of this project in increasing our predictive power about eco-evolutionary dynamics is warranted by the experience of the PI, at the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches. Our experiments will have relevance beyond academia, as we will modify through evolution the plasticity of traits (accumulation of energetic cell metabolites) that are direct targets for bioindustry, thus potentially overcoming current limitations in productivity.",

The need for predicting eco-evolutionary impacts of plastic and evolutionary responses to changing environments is still hampered by lack of strong experimental evidence. FluctEvol aims at shedding a new light on population responses to stochastic environments, and facilitating their prediction, using a unique combination of approaches. First, theoretical models of evolution and demography under a randomly changing optimum phenotype will be designed and analysed, producing new quantitative predictions. Second, statistical methodologies will be developed, and employed in meta-analyses of long-term datasets from natural populations. And third, large-scale and automated experimental evolution in stochastic environments will be carried out with the micro-alga Dunaliella salina, an extremophile that thrives at high and variable salinities. We will manipulate the magnitude and predictability of fluctuations in salinity, and use high-throughput phenotyping and candidate-gene sequencing to analyse the evolution of plasticity for traits involved in salinity adaptation in this species: glycerol and carotene content. We will thus combine the benefits of experimental evolution in microbes (short generations, ample replication) with a priori knowledge of ecologically relevant adaptive traits, allowing for hypothesis-driven experiments. The success of this project in increasing our predictive power about eco-evolutionary dynamics is warranted by the experience of the PI, at the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches. Our experiments will have relevance beyond academia, as we will modify through evolution the plasticity of traits (accumulation of energetic cell metabolites) that are direct targets for bioindustry, thus potentially overcoming current limitations in productivity.",

    "project_objective": "There is rising concern that several subsystems of the Earth may respond highly nonlinearly at critical future levels of anthropogenic forcing; these levels have recently been associated with tipping points (TPs). It is paramount to identify safe operating spaces for humanity and the planet in terms of these critical forcing levels, in order to prevent harmful transitions to alternative, undesirable states of the Earth system. The mechanisms leading to such abrupt transitions are only partly understood, and further research in this regard is urgently needed. State-of-art Earth System Models appear to respond too smoothly at TPs and have difficulties in simulating abrupt transitions that occurred in the planet\u2019s history.   TiPES will address these problems from several angles: 1. The project will identify subsystems that may exhibit abrupt transitions, and couplings between them, by focussing on paleoclimatic records and abrupt transitions therein. Novel methods to detect Early Warning Signals of forthcoming TPs, and to make skilful predictions on their basis, will be developed. 2. The potential shortcomings of models in representing TPs will be evaluated; in particular, TiPES will investigate how Bayesian calibration techniques can help enable these models to simulate past abrupt transitions.  3. TiPES will develop a generalized theory of climate sensitivity that accounts for the presence of TPs and feedbacks across various time scales.  4. To define safe operating spaces. TiPES will focus on dynamical system theory and on global stability notions for non-autonomous systems in order to estimate the stability of desirable states.  5. The results obtained by the project will be communicated to policy makers in a manner that facilitates decisions and their implementation. TiPES will develop formal approaches to define the socioeconomic risks of crossing TPs, and to derive decision strategies to keep anthropogenic forcing below levels where abrupt transitions may occur.",

Measuring the effectiveness of GHG emission reduction policies against agreed-upon international targets require accurate and precise estimates of emissions and their trends. These estimates need to be established and regularly updated using transparent methods, tracable to international standards. VERIFY proposes to quantify more accurately carbon stocks and the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) across the EU based on independent observations in support of inventories that rely only on statistical data.  The same approach will also be tested for US, China and Indonesia, in collaboration with foreign partnes. Accurate characterization of the space-time variations of GHG fluxes, separating their anthropogenic and natural components and their drivers, will be based on advanced modelling approaches using atmospheric GHG measurements, tracer transport inversions and various arrays of land observations, in-situ and from space. The improved knowledge of GHG budgets from VERIFY will be used to improve national inventories, in collaboration with national inventory agencies, and to deliver policy-relevant information to track progress of the EU mitigation efforts to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement on Climate, in line with international cooperation mechanisms promoted by the WMO, the IPCC and the UNFCCC.",

Understanding such variations requires insights from the past. However, no data sets of past climate are available to study decadal variability of large-scale climate with state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Currently available data sets are limited to statistical reconstructions of local or regional surface climate. The PALAEO-RA project will produce the first ever comprehensive, 3-dimensional, physically consistent reconstruction of the global climate system at a monthly scale for the past six centuries. This palaeoreanalysis is based on combining information from early instrumental measurements, historical documents (e.g. capitalizing on large amounts of newly available data from China), and proxies (e.g. tree rings) with a large ensemble of climate model simulations. To achieve this novel combination, a completely new data assimilation system for palaeoclimatological data will be developed. The unique data sets produced in this project will become reference data sets for studying past climatic variations (i) for diagnostic studies of interannual-to-decadal variability, (ii) as a benchmark for model simulations and (iii) for climate impact studies. Using the data produced, the project will analyse episodes of slowed or accelerated global warming, decadal subtropical drought periods, episodes of expanding or contracting tropics, slowed or strengthened monsoons, changes in storm tracks, blocking and associated weather extremes, and links between Arctic and midlatitude climate. The analyses will provide new insights into the processes governing decadal variability of weather and climate.",

CS are seen by this consortium as driven by user demands to provide knowledge to face impacts of climate variability and change, as well as guidance both to researchers and decision\u2010makers in policy and business. <br/>ERA4CS will focus on the development of a \u201cclimate information translation\u201d layer bridging \u201cuser communities\u201d and \u201cclimate system sciences\u201d. It implies the development of tools, methods, standards and quality control for reliable, qualified and tailored information required by the various field actors for smart decisions.<br/>ERA4CS will boost the JPI Climate initiative by mobilizing more countries, within EU Member States and Associated Countries, by involving both the research performing organizations (RPOs) and the research funding organizations (RFOs), the distinct national climate services and the various disciplines of academia, including Social Sciences and Humanities. ERA4CS will launch a joint transnational co-funded call, with over 16 countries and up to 75M\u20ac, with two complementary topics: (i) a \u201ccash\u201d topic, supported by 12 RFOs, on co-development for user needs and action-oriented projects; (ii) an \u201cin-kind\u201d topic, supported by 28 RPOs, on institutional integration of the research components of national CS. <br/>Finally, ERA4CS additional activities will initiate a strong partnership between JPI Climate and others key European and international initiatives (as Copernicus, KIC-Climate, JPIs, WMO/GFCS, Future Earth, Belmont Forum\u2026) in order to work towards a common vision and a multiyear implementation strategy, including better co-alignment of national programs and activities up to 2020 and beyond.",

This will be achieved through innovative integration of models and observations, providing new constraints on modelled carbon-climate interactions and climate projections, and supporting IPCC assessments and policy objectives. To meet this objective, 4C will (a) provide a step change in our ability to quantify the key processes regulating the coupled carbon-climate system, (b) use observational constraints and improved processes understanding to provide multi-model near-term predictions and long-term projections of the climate in response to anthropogenic emissions, and (c) deliver policy-relevant carbon dioxide emission pathways consistent with the UNFCCC Paris Agreement (PA) goals.  <br/>To achieve its goals, 4C will develop and use: state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) including biogeochemical processes not included in previous IPCC reports; novel observations to constrain the contemporary carbon cycle and its natural variability; ESM-based decadal predictions including carbon-climate feedbacks and novel initialisation methods; novel emergent constraints and weighting methods to reduce uncertainty in carbon cycle and climate projections; and novel climate scenarios following adaptive CO2 emission pathways. <br/>4C will support two central elements of the PA. First, the PA global stocktakes, by providing policy-relevant predictions of atmospheric CO2 and climate in response to the national determined contributions.

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

Three related user communities lie at the heart of the CoE: academic, industrial and clinical researchers who all wish to build, develop and extend such capabilities in line with the increasing power of high performance computers. Three distinct exemplar research areas will be pursued: cardiovascular, molecularly-based and neuro-musculoskeletal medicine.<br/> <br/>Predictive computational biomedicine involves applications that are comprised of multiple components, arranged as far as possible into automated workflows in which data is taken, from an individual patient, processed, and combined into a model which produces predicted health outcomes. Many of the models are multiscale, requiring the coupling of two or more high performance codes. Computational biomedicine holds out the prospect of predicting the effect of personalised medical treatments and interventions ahead of carrying them out, with all the ensuing benefits. Indeed, in some cases, it is already doing so today.<br/> <br/>The CoE presents a powerful consortium of partners and has an outward facing nature and will actively train, disseminate and engage with these user communities across Europe and beyond. Because this field is new and growing rapidly, it offers numerous innovative opportunities. There are three SMEs and three enterprises within the project, as well as eight associate partners drawn from across the biomedical sector, who are fully aware of the vast potential of HPC in this domain. We shall work with them to advance the exploitation of HPC and will engage closely with medical professionals through our partner hospitals in order to establish modeling and simulation as an integral part of clinical decision making. Our CoE is thus user-driven, integrated, multidisciplinary, and distributed; presenting a vision that is in line with the Work Programme.",

Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

Understanding these feedback processes is a huge intellectual challenge. In part because of the pioneering work of the PI (Cox et al., 2000), many of the climate projections reported in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) now include climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. However the latest Earth System Models (ESMs) continue to show a huge range in the projected responses of the land carbon cycle over the 21st century. This uncertainty threatens to undermine the value of these projections to inform climate policy.  This project (ECCLES) is designed to produce significant reductions in the uncertainties associated with land-climate interactions, using the novel concept of Emergent Constraints - relationships between future projections and observable variations in the current Earth System that are common across the ensemble of ESMs. Emergent Constraints have many attractive features but chief amongst these is that they can make ensembles of ESMs more than the sum of the parts - allowing the full range of ESM projections to be used collectively, alongside key observations, to reduce uncertainties in the future climate. The project will deliver: (i) a theoretical foundation for Emergent Constraints; (ii) new datasets on the changing function of the land biosphere; (iii) Emergent Constraints on land-climate interactions based on observed temporal and spatial variations; (iv) a new generation of scientists expert in land-climate interactions and Emergent Constraints. ECCLES will benefit from the expertise and experience of the PI, which includes training as a theoretical physicist, an early career developing models of the land biosphere for ESMs, and a current career in a department of mathematics where he is at the forefront of efforts to develop and apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (Cox et al., 2013, Wenzel et al., 2016).",

By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications.

Despite many successes, a number of key questions still remain, which are of the uttermost importance to understand plate tectonics. What is the nature of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary? What is the structure and history of the continental lithosphere? <br/><br/>The problem is that different seismic observables sample the Earth at different scales; they have different sensitivity to structure, and are usually interpreted separately. Images obtained from short period converted and reflected body waves see sharp discontinuities, and are interpreted in terms of thermo-chemical stratification, whereas seismic models constructed from long period seismograms depict a smooth and anisotropic upper mantle, and are usually interpreted in terms of mantle flow. However, sharp discontinuities may also produce effective anisotropy at large scales, and only a joint interpretation of different frequency bands can allow to fully localizing the patterns of deformation in the mantle. <br/><br/>The proposed work consists in developing and applying an entirely new approach to geophysical data interpretation, where different data types sampling the Earth at different scales are jointly embraced into a single Bayesian procedure. This proposal focuses on theoretical, algorithmic and computational advances needed for a new generation of tomographic models. We will use the large amount of data available in North-America (surface wave measurements, scattered body waves, SKS splitting measurements) to produce a multiscale model under North-America, depicting both discontinuities and anisotropy. This will allow us to answer some crucial questions about the structure and evolution of Earth. We will also produce a first fully Bayesian global Earth model by jointly inverting normal modes, surface and body wave observations.",

    "project_objective": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord affecting some 40,000 individuals in Europe, causing 11,000 deaths each year. Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

The aging population and the dramatically increasing age of parenthood are associated with grave medical problems, declining reproductive health, and severe consequences for the socio-economic well-being of our societies. These proboems will impact the demographic structure and societal welfare in the European population. Thus the urgent need to understand the biological basis and to identify risk factors and pathways of the steep age-dependent decline in female and male germ cell quality. GermAge will address mostly the aging female gametogenesis known to be most severely affected by aging, but also the important contribution of aging male germ cells to age-related fertility and inheritance problems. The decay of key chromosome proteins such as cohesins, the failure of quality control mechanisms such as the spindle assembly checkpoint, and the mutation load in aging spermatogonial stem cells are among the highly synergetic research topics of GermAge. Mouse and human germ cells will be analyzed by high-end and innovative techniques. The expected insights will eventually lead to much improved diagnostics in various reproductive medicine procedures such as quality control of germ cells frozen for delayed in vitro fertilization, development of new biomarkers for oocytes, risk assessment for inherited diseases including aneuploidie in carriers of specific mutations, and prognosis based on individualized genomics on age-related quality decline of oocytes and spermatocytes. We also expect that our findings will raise awareness of the risks associated with postponing parenthood, leading to a much-needed prioritization on the public health agenda.",

As such, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and effective prevention and treatment strategies. As numerous clinical trials have shown, lifestyle modification is by far the best way to prevent these diseases, with lifestyle being twice as effective as the best drugs, less costly and free from side effects. Yet, human biology is complex, causing some people to respond well and others poorly to the same lifestyle interventions. Thus, a huge, as yet unrealised opportunity exists to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases by tailoring lifestyle interventions to the patient\u2019s unique biology. <br/>NASCENT is an integrated programme of research through which I will functionally annotate and later translate discoveries of gene-lifestyle interactions made through the interrogation of large epidemiological (N>100,000) datasets at my disposal. The functional annotation of these discoveries will be done using state-of-the-art epigenomic and targeted gene editing tools, whereas the translation of those findings will be achieved using a innovative and powerful clinical trial design that focuses on treatments that are tailored to the participant\u2019s genotype (genotype-based recall). <br/>NASCENT capitalizes on a solid foundation of cohorts, methods, and expertise that I have built-up over the past fifteen years, but also exploits state-of-the-art epigenomic and gene-editing technologies that have not previously been used in studies of gene-lifestyle interactions. I expect the integration of these established and new approaches in NASCENT to propel major advances in understanding gene-lifestyle interactions in cardiometabolic disease that help optimise disease prevention.",

Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals.

Indeed this relentless evolution is the major driver of treatment failure for diseases that are responsible for over half of the global disease related mortality. Yet, the underlying principles that guide this evolutionary response are poorly understood, in particular with regards to understanding the impact of multidrug treatment.  <br/>LimitMDR will characterize evolutionary trajectories leading to multidrug resistance in response to individual and combination drug treatment through the execution of large-scale adaptive evolution experiment with two bacterial pathogens followed by genome sequencing and phenotyping. This effort will enable testing of contrasting hypotheses regarding the evolution of multidrug resistance in response to combination treatment.   <br/><br/>We will characterize the cause-and-effect of resistance and sensitivity mutations identified in our global data set and map comprehensive fitness landscapes of mutations accumulated during drug resistance evolution to understand the evolutionary dynamics underlying resistance evolution. To accomplish these bold goals we shall develop novel multiplexed methodologies enabling unprecedented scale of construction and phenotypic testing of identified mutations. While genetic epistasis is considered of key importance to resistance evolution most studies focus on mutations within an individual gene. Through the development of a novel experimental approach we shall elucidate complex epistatic interaction networks between mutations accumulated during resistance evolution. <br/><br/>Finally, we will conduct mechanistic studies to uncover the mechanisms of collateral sensitivity. These studies will shed light on this underappreciated phenomenon, which is of critical relevance to drug discovery and the evolution of drug resistance.

Despite their importance, all proposed molecular models for transport are based on indirect evidence due to the inability of classical biophysical and biochemical techniques to directly visualize dynamic structural changes. To solve this problem, I suggest a novel approach that can decipher the molecular mechanisms of transport, with the ultimate goal to use this knowledge against pathogenic bacteria, for treatment of ABC-related diseases or multi-drug resistance of cancer cells.<br/>I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy for the study of conformational states of an ABC model system in vitro, and thus to observe directly how elementary transport steps are coordinated. This will open up a virtually unexplored biophysical research area and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC transporters. The key questions of this proposal are:<br/><br/>Aim 1: What is the mechanism of substrate binding in ABC transporters? The conformational equilibrium (open vs. closed state) of ABC-associated substrate-binding proteins will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism of binding, i.e. induced fit vs. conformational selection.<br/><br/>Aim 2: What are relevant conformational states and changes for substrate translocation? The time- and length-scales of conformational changes in transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains as well as interactions with other domains will be characterized using the osmoregulator OpuA as a model system.<br/><br/>Aim 3: How are substrate binding, energy utilization and translocation coordinated in ABC transporters? Finally, a complete model of transport will be developed to decipher the coordination of transport events, i.e. how substrate binding and ATP-hydrolysis are coupled and transferred into conformational changes that drive substrate transport.",

Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

Strategies to generate required tissues using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are associated with either ethical or medical safety issues. An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates.

Currently, identification of RA-patients before the classic presentation with clinically evident chronic arthritis is beyond the state of the art. I here aim to achieve this early recognition by increasing the mechanistic understanding of pre-arthritis phases.<br/> <br/>I intend to study RA-specific auto-immune responses at the cellular and humoral level as well as markers reflecting local and systemic inflammation.

My research concept is to integrate the products of separate trajectories in a longitudinal study and translate it to the clinic. <br/><br/>Patients with CSA will be studied serially in time. Using validated methods and novel techniques and insights we will: delineate molecular and predictive features of RA-specific auto-antibodies and auto-antibody secreting B-cells, identify improved markers of systemic inflammation and test and validate a computer-aided image analysis system to detect subclinical joint inflammation on MRI. Serial data will be combined to reveal interactions between markers and time relationships. Lastly a prediction model identifying imminent RA will be developed.

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

But oncogenic PVs are actually an unfortunate exception, as most PVs cause asymptomatic infections, and a few cause benign, wart-like lesions. Despite the efforts directed towards the understanding of the different clinical manifestations of infection, our knowledge on PV evolution remains fragmentary.<br/>Oncogenic human PVs arose recently, after acquiring the E5, E6 and E7 genes. The integration of the E5 proto-oncogene in the ancestral AlphaPV genome allowed viruses to evade host immune response. Thereafter E6 and E7 acquired the ability to target essential tumor suppressor proteins, paving the way for carcinogenesis. Tracking the evolutionary history of the E5, E6 and E7 oncogenes will thus help understand the emergence of oncogenic human PVs. Regarding the deep roots of PVs, small DNA viruses may share a common ancestor as they encode proteins sharing similar functions and domains, but their evolutionary origin is still an enigma.<br/>Here I propose to apply an evolutionary medicine approach, combining in silico and wet-lab approaches, to study key events that occurred during PV genome evolution. We will go back into history and study how and when certain PVs became oncogenic. We will resurrect the ancestral oncogenes, and experimentally test hypotheses about the function of the resurrected proteins in different environmental contexts. We will then generate a comprehensive scenario modelling the appearance of the modern PV genome and the emergence of the oncogenic phenotype of certain PVs. Finally we will explore the relationships between small DNA viruses and test whether they may have a common origin. Our ultimate aim is to understand why a few PVs are oncogenic for a few host species, while most PVs cause asymptomatic infections in most hosts.",

      "Many of these engineered viruses are viable and express heterologous proteins at high levels, but the inserted sequences often prove to be unstable over time and are rapidly lost, limiting heterologous protein expression.",

      "Here, we review experimental work on the stability of inserted sequences over a broad range of viruses, and we present some theoretical considerations concerning insert stability.",
      "Different virus genome organizations strongly impact insert stability, and factors such as the position of insertion can have a strong effect.",
      "In addition, we argue that insert stability not only depends on the characteristics of a particular genome, but that it will also depend on the host environment and the demography of a virus population.",
      "The interplay between all factors affecting stability is complex, which makes it challenging to develop a general model to predict the stability of genomic insertions.",
      "We highlight key questions and future directions, finding that insert stability is a surprisingly complex problem and that there is need for mechanism-based, predictive models.",
      "Combining theoretical models with experimental tests for stability under varying conditions can lead to improved engineering of viral modified genomes, which is a valuable tool for understanding genome evolution as well as for biotechnological applications, such as gene therapy."

NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020.

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

The need for predicting eco-evolutionary impacts of plastic and evolutionary responses to changing environments is still hampered by lack of strong experimental evidence. FluctEvol aims at shedding a new light on population responses to stochastic environments, and facilitating their prediction, using a unique combination of approaches. First, theoretical models of evolution and demography under a randomly changing optimum phenotype will be designed and analysed, producing new quantitative predictions. Second, statistical methodologies will be developed, and employed in meta-analyses of long-term datasets from natural populations. And third, large-scale and automated experimental evolution in stochastic environments will be carried out with the micro-alga Dunaliella salina, an extremophile that thrives at high and variable salinities. We will manipulate the magnitude and predictability of fluctuations in salinity, and use high-throughput phenotyping and candidate-gene sequencing to analyse the evolution of plasticity for traits involved in salinity adaptation in this species: glycerol and carotene content. We will thus combine the benefits of experimental evolution in microbes (short generations, ample replication) with a priori knowledge of ecologically relevant adaptive traits, allowing for hypothesis-driven experiments. The success of this project in increasing our predictive power about eco-evolutionary dynamics is warranted by the experience of the PI, at the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches. Our experiments will have relevance beyond academia, as we will modify through evolution the plasticity of traits (accumulation of energetic cell metabolites) that are direct targets for bioindustry, thus potentially overcoming current limitations in productivity.",

MHC proteins are essential for initiating every adaptive immune response and MHC is probably the most extreme example of how selection from a wide range of pathogens maintains high diversity in host immunity genes. However, the functions of the MHC proteins are only known in humans and model organisms, species that cannot be studied under natural conditions. There is therefore a need to study function of MHC proteins in species that can be thoroughly monitored in their natural habitat under varying pathogen regimes and over several generations. These parameters can be assessed in wild songbirds making them excellent study systems. Songbirds have large numbers of MHC gene copies, although little is known about how these affect their immune responses. Does high MHC copy number indicate that songbirds can recognize and combat more pathogens than other animals? They do fight infections satisfactory at their breeding, stopover and overwintering sites. <br/><br/>In this proposal my overarching aim is a more mechanistic understanding for survival and fitness linked to MHC in animals from wild populations and to take this field of research beyond the simple correlative associations that hitherto have been the rule. To reach this goal I must first characterize songbird MHC, now possible with \u2018single molecule real time sequencing\u2019. Therefore a rather substantial part of this proposal is technology. I will use two different songbird study systems; long-distance migratory great reed warblers and sedentary house sparrows and malaria-like pathogens infecting both these species. I am an experienced researcher on MHC and together with my team I will (1) characterize the MHC genomic region, (2) measure expression of MHC genes, (3) build MHC proteins and (4) measure functional MHC diversity in relation to fitness in wild birds, both in nature and in experimental set-ups.",

    "project_objective": "We outline a 5 year programme that introduces a new platform for the preparation, understanding, and exploitation of precisely defined nano-molecules / materials based upon the assembly of molecular metal oxide precursors (polyoxometalates) under non-equilibrium conditions with well-defined physical properties using automated intelligent feedback. We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

    "project_objective": "The Land Biosphere is a critical component of the Earth System, linking to climate through multiple feedback processes. Understanding these feedback processes is a huge intellectual challenge. In part because of the pioneering work of the PI (Cox et al., 2000), many of the climate projections reported in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) now include climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. However the latest Earth System Models (ESMs) continue to show a huge range in the projected responses of the land carbon cycle over the 21st century. This uncertainty threatens to undermine the value of these projections to inform climate policy.  This project (ECCLES) is designed to produce significant reductions in the uncertainties associated with land-climate interactions, using the novel concept of Emergent Constraints - relationships between future projections and observable variations in the current Earth System that are common across the ensemble of ESMs. Emergent Constraints have many attractive features but chief amongst these is that they can make ensembles of ESMs more than the sum of the parts - allowing the full range of ESM projections to be used collectively, alongside key observations, to reduce uncertainties in the future climate. The project will deliver: (i) a theoretical foundation for Emergent Constraints; (ii) new datasets on the changing function of the land biosphere; (iii) Emergent Constraints on land-climate interactions based on observed temporal and spatial variations; (iv) a new generation of scientists expert in land-climate interactions and Emergent Constraints. ECCLES will benefit from the expertise and experience of the PI, which includes training as a theoretical physicist, an early career developing models of the land biosphere for ESMs, and a current career in a department of mathematics where he is at the forefront of efforts to develop and apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (Cox et al., 2013, Wenzel et al., 2016).",

But oncogenic PVs are actually an unfortunate exception, as most PVs cause asymptomatic infections, and a few cause benign, wart-like lesions. Despite the efforts directed towards the understanding of the different clinical manifestations of infection, our knowledge on PV evolution remains fragmentary.<br/>Oncogenic human PVs arose recently, after acquiring the E5, E6 and E7 genes. The integration of the E5 proto-oncogene in the ancestral AlphaPV genome allowed viruses to evade host immune response. Thereafter E6 and E7 acquired the ability to target essential tumor suppressor proteins, paving the way for carcinogenesis. Tracking the evolutionary history of the E5, E6 and E7 oncogenes will thus help understand the emergence of oncogenic human PVs. Regarding the deep roots of PVs, small DNA viruses may share a common ancestor as they encode proteins sharing similar functions and domains, but their evolutionary origin is still an enigma.<br/>Here I propose to apply an evolutionary medicine approach, combining in silico and wet-lab approaches, to study key events that occurred during PV genome evolution. We will go back into history and study how and when certain PVs became oncogenic. We will resurrect the ancestral oncogenes, and experimentally test hypotheses about the function of the resurrected proteins in different environmental contexts. We will then generate a comprehensive scenario modelling the appearance of the modern PV genome and the emergence of the oncogenic phenotype of certain PVs. Finally we will explore the relationships between small DNA viruses and test whether they may have a common origin. Our ultimate aim is to understand why a few PVs are oncogenic for a few host species, while most PVs cause asymptomatic infections in most hosts.",

A major challenge for climate change science is to develop an understanding of the sensitivity of organisms to the changing environment, and try and find spatial, broad taxonomic or trait based generalities that will enable more accurate identification of regions and ecosystems at severe risk of climate change impacts (sensitivity hotspots) so that mitigation and adaptive management actions can be prioritised. There are, however, several challenges associated with predicting sensitivity hotspots. At the forefront of these challenges is our understanding of the drivers of organism\u2019s thermal tolerance thresholds, and the proximity of temperature thresholds to the local climate extremes and climate change projections, herein called thermal safety margin (TSM). This project merges concepts from physiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, biogeography and physical oceanography into an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that exposes inconsistencies among current paradigms and fundamental limitations to our understanding of the sensitivity of marine organisms to climate change. The conceptual framework presented here offers a testable, interdisciplinary model to address this knowledge gap. Specifically we ask the questions 1) How do patterns in thermal tolerance breadth and thermal safety margins vary throughout species\u2019 geographical ranges? And 2) What are the environmental drivers, biotic traits and evolutionary factors that determine an organisms thermal tolerance? Through identifying the nature of thermal tolerance patterns and identifying some of the mechanisms influencing these patterns, this research aims to increase the accuracy and resolution of predictions of the sensitivity of marine biota to climate change.",

Accurate characterization of the space-time variations of GHG fluxes, separating their anthropogenic and natural components and their drivers, will be based on advanced modelling approaches using atmospheric GHG measurements, tracer transport inversions and various arrays of land observations, in-situ and from space. The improved knowledge of GHG budgets from VERIFY will be used to improve national inventories, in collaboration with national inventory agencies, and to deliver policy-relevant information to track progress of the EU mitigation efforts to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement on Climate, in line with international cooperation mechanisms promoted by the WMO, the IPCC and the UNFCCC.",

Moreover, the pharmaceutical industry partners provide expertise to ensure optimal selection and validation of clinically relevant biomarkers and new targets. Our conceptual personalized approach can readily be adapted to other immune-mediated diseases with a complex gene-lifestyle background and broad clinical spectrum with heterogeneity in treatment response.<br/> <br/>MultipleMS therefore goes significantly beyond current state-of-the-art thereby broadly affecting European policies, healthcare systems, innovation in translating big data and basic research into evidence-based personalized clinical applications.",

    "project_objective": "The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains makes tuberculosis (TB) a key priority for infectious disease research. Inflammation and autophagy are two fundamental processes critical to TB pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence shows that TB disease is worsened by deregulation of the inflammatory response. On the other hand, autophagy has recently emerged as a crucial host defence mechanism. Autophagy counteracts the ability of mycobacteria to survive inside host cells and targets them for degradation. Autophagy is also thought to control the inflammatory response. However, the interaction between inflammation and autophagy in host defence against TB remains unclear. The aim of my proposal is to use the well-established zebrafish model of TB to gain insight into this key question. Recently, the host laboratory discovered that the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM1) protects against TB in the zebrafish model. They also implicated this important autophagy regulator in inflammation, as it strongly affects expression of interleukin-1beta (IL1B). I have specific expertise in studying IL1B-mediated inflammation in zebrafish. Thus the proposed project will be a great synergy between me and the host laboratory, which is leading in zebrafish infectious disease research. I will determine how modulation of autophagy or manipulation of IL1B levels reciprocally influence each other during TB disease. The zebrafish model provides excellent tools to visualize these processes in vivo. Furthermore, I will take advantage of the host\u2019s expertise in RNA sequencing and proteomics to study genome-wide effects of autophagy modulation on the inflammatory response. A secondment will allow me to compare results in the TB model with a damage-induced inflammation model. The project will provide new insights into regulatory pathways that could potentially be intervened in treatment of TB or other inflammatory diseases with common characteristics.",

These proboems will impact the demographic structure and societal welfare in the European population. Thus the urgent need to understand the biological basis and to identify risk factors and pathways of the steep age-dependent decline in female and male germ cell quality. GermAge will address mostly the aging female gametogenesis known to be most severely affected by aging, but also the important contribution of aging male germ cells to age-related fertility and inheritance problems. The decay of key chromosome proteins such as cohesins, the failure of quality control mechanisms such as the spindle assembly checkpoint, and the mutation load in aging spermatogonial stem cells are among the highly synergetic research topics of GermAge. Mouse and human germ cells will be analyzed by high-end and innovative techniques. The expected insights will eventually lead to much improved diagnostics in various reproductive medicine procedures such as quality control of germ cells frozen for delayed in vitro fertilization, development of new biomarkers for oocytes, risk assessment for inherited diseases including aneuploidie in carriers of specific mutations, and prognosis based on individualized genomics on age-related quality decline of oocytes and spermatocytes.

Strategies to generate required tissues using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are associated with either ethical or medical safety issues. An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates.

Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "project_objective": "There is rising concern that several subsystems of the Earth may respond highly nonlinearly at critical future levels of anthropogenic forcing; these levels have recently been associated with tipping points (TPs). It is paramount to identify safe operating spaces for humanity and the planet in terms of these critical forcing levels, in order to prevent harmful transitions to alternative, undesirable states of the Earth system. The mechanisms leading to such abrupt transitions are only partly understood, and further research in this regard is urgently needed. State-of-art Earth System Models appear to respond too smoothly at TPs and have difficulties in simulating abrupt transitions that occurred in the planet\u2019s history.   TiPES will address these problems from several angles: 1. The project will identify subsystems that may exhibit abrupt transitions, and couplings between them, by focussing on paleoclimatic records and abrupt transitions therein. Novel methods to detect Early Warning Signals of forthcoming TPs, and to make skilful predictions on their basis, will be developed. 2. The potential shortcomings of models in representing TPs will be evaluated; in particular, TiPES will investigate how Bayesian calibration techniques can help enable these models to simulate past abrupt transitions.  3. TiPES will develop a generalized theory of climate sensitivity that accounts for the presence of TPs and feedbacks across various time scales.  4. To define safe operating spaces. TiPES will focus on dynamical system theory and on global stability notions for non-autonomous systems in order to estimate the stability of desirable states.  5. The results obtained by the project will be communicated to policy makers in a manner that facilitates decisions and their implementation. TiPES will develop formal approaches to define the socioeconomic risks of crossing TPs, and to derive decision strategies to keep anthropogenic forcing below levels where abrupt transitions may occur.",

The need for predicting eco-evolutionary impacts of plastic and evolutionary responses to changing environments is still hampered by lack of strong experimental evidence. FluctEvol aims at shedding a new light on population responses to stochastic environments, and facilitating their prediction, using a unique combination of approaches. First, theoretical models of evolution and demography under a randomly changing optimum phenotype will be designed and analysed, producing new quantitative predictions. Second, statistical methodologies will be developed, and employed in meta-analyses of long-term datasets from natural populations. And third, large-scale and automated experimental evolution in stochastic environments will be carried out with the micro-alga Dunaliella salina, an extremophile that thrives at high and variable salinities. We will manipulate the magnitude and predictability of fluctuations in salinity, and use high-throughput phenotyping and candidate-gene sequencing to analyse the evolution of plasticity for traits involved in salinity adaptation in this species: glycerol and carotene content. We will thus combine the benefits of experimental evolution in microbes (short generations, ample replication) with a priori knowledge of ecologically relevant adaptive traits, allowing for hypothesis-driven experiments. The success of this project in increasing our predictive power about eco-evolutionary dynamics is warranted by the experience of the PI, at the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches. Our experiments will have relevance beyond academia, as we will modify through evolution the plasticity of traits (accumulation of energetic cell metabolites) that are direct targets for bioindustry, thus potentially overcoming current limitations in productivity.",

MHC proteins are essential for initiating every adaptive immune response and MHC is probably the most extreme example of how selection from a wide range of pathogens maintains high diversity in host immunity genes. However, the functions of the MHC proteins are only known in humans and model organisms, species that cannot be studied under natural conditions. There is therefore a need to study function of MHC proteins in species that can be thoroughly monitored in their natural habitat under varying pathogen regimes and over several generations. These parameters can be assessed in wild songbirds making them excellent study systems. Songbirds have large numbers of MHC gene copies, although little is known about how these affect their immune responses. Does high MHC copy number indicate that songbirds can recognize and combat more pathogens than other animals? They do fight infections satisfactory at their breeding, stopover and overwintering sites. <br/><br/>In this proposal my overarching aim is a more mechanistic understanding for survival and fitness linked to MHC in animals from wild populations and to take this field of research beyond the simple correlative associations that hitherto have been the rule. To reach this goal I must first characterize songbird MHC, now possible with \u2018single molecule real time sequencing\u2019. Therefore a rather substantial part of this proposal is technology. I will use two different songbird study systems; long-distance migratory great reed warblers and sedentary house sparrows and malaria-like pathogens infecting both these species.

    "project_objective": "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease in the aging population of Europe. NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

Because WM has limited capacity, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that govern selective access to it. I hypothesise that 1) selective access to WM is governed by states of the brain prior to the encoding and retrieval of sensory information (in particular the phase and amplitude of neural oscillations in the different sensory cortices), and that 2) changes in these states provide a common neural substrate through which several cognitive variables affect WM. I will use magneto-encephalography (MEG) to investigate several key aspects of these central hypotheses in healthy human volunteers. This will advance our understanding of the neural and cognitive mechanisms that govern selective access to WM and could ultimately be used to present relevant information when the brain is most susceptible to incorporate this into WM. The project will be carried out at the Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity, together with leading scientist in the electrophysiological study of WM (Anna Christina Nobre and Mark Stokes) and the analysis of MEG data (Mark Woolrich).

The need for predicting eco-evolutionary impacts of plastic and evolutionary responses to changing environments is still hampered by lack of strong experimental evidence. FluctEvol aims at shedding a new light on population responses to stochastic environments, and facilitating their prediction, using a unique combination of approaches. First, theoretical models of evolution and demography under a randomly changing optimum phenotype will be designed and analysed, producing new quantitative predictions. Second, statistical methodologies will be developed, and employed in meta-analyses of long-term datasets from natural populations. And third, large-scale and automated experimental evolution in stochastic environments will be carried out with the micro-alga Dunaliella salina, an extremophile that thrives at high and variable salinities. We will manipulate the magnitude and predictability of fluctuations in salinity, and use high-throughput phenotyping and candidate-gene sequencing to analyse the evolution of plasticity for traits involved in salinity adaptation in this species: glycerol and carotene content. We will thus combine the benefits of experimental evolution in microbes (short generations, ample replication) with a priori knowledge of ecologically relevant adaptive traits, allowing for hypothesis-driven experiments. The success of this project in increasing our predictive power about eco-evolutionary dynamics is warranted by the experience of the PI, at the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches. Our experiments will have relevance beyond academia, as we will modify through evolution the plasticity of traits (accumulation of energetic cell metabolites) that are direct targets for bioindustry, thus potentially overcoming current limitations in productivity.",

Still, we do not understand the dynamics and impact of climatic and biotic BVOC emission drivers in arctic and alpine tundra, which are highly temperature-sensitive BVOC sources.<br/>TUVOLU will redefine tundra BVOC emission estimates to account for rapid and dramatic climate warming accompanied by effects of vegetation change, permafrost thaw, insect outbreaks and herbivory using multidisciplinary, established and novel methodology.<br/>We will quantify the relationships between leaf and canopy temperatures and BVOC emissions to improve BVOC emission model predictions of emission rates in low-statured tundra vegetation, which efficiently heats up. We will experimentally determine the contribution of induced BVOC emissions from insect herbivory in the warming Arctic by field manipulation experiments addressing basal herbivory and insect outbreaks and by stable isotope labelling to identify sources of the induced emission. Complementary laboratory assessment will determine if permafrost thaw leads to significant BVOC emissions from thawing processes and newly available soil processes, or if released BVOCs are largely taken up by soil microbes. We will also use a global network of existing climate warming experiments in alpine tundra to assess how the BVOC emissions from tundra vegetation world-wide respond to climate change.<br/>Measurement data will help develop and parameterize BVOC emission models to produce holistic enhanced predictions for global tundra emissions. Finally, modelling will be used to estimate emission impact on tropospheric ozone concentrations and secondary organic aerosol levels, producing the first assessment of arctic BVOC-mediated feedback on regional air quality and climate.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

As such, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and effective prevention and treatment strategies. As numerous clinical trials have shown, lifestyle modification is by far the best way to prevent these diseases, with lifestyle being twice as effective as the best drugs, less costly and free from side effects. Yet, human biology is complex, causing some people to respond well and others poorly to the same lifestyle interventions. Thus, a huge, as yet unrealised opportunity exists to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases by tailoring lifestyle interventions to the patient\u2019s unique biology. <br/>NASCENT is an integrated programme of research through which I will functionally annotate and later translate discoveries of gene-lifestyle interactions made through the interrogation of large epidemiological (N>100,000) datasets at my disposal. The functional annotation of these discoveries will be done using state-of-the-art epigenomic and targeted gene editing tools, whereas the translation of those findings will be achieved using a innovative and powerful clinical trial design that focuses on treatments that are tailored to the participant\u2019s genotype (genotype-based recall). <br/>NASCENT capitalizes on a solid foundation of cohorts, methods, and expertise that I have built-up over the past fifteen years, but also exploits state-of-the-art epigenomic and gene-editing technologies that have not previously been used in studies of gene-lifestyle interactions.

Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development.

    "project_objective": "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease in the aging population of Europe. NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

    "project_objective": "Animals harbor specialized bacterial communities in their guts, typically referred to as gut microbiomes. Despite the importance of gut microbiomes for host health, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. There is evidence that the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome has emerged through the diversification of a few founder lineages. However, how lineages have diversified into discrete species and which underlying mechanisms maintain the diversity in the gut remains elusive. The current project will address these questions by studying the gut microbiome of honey bees. We have recently found that the eight dominant bacterial lineages in the honey bee gut have substantially diversified, which is a striking parallelism to the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome. Moreover, we have established experiments to colonize microbiota-free bees with cultured isolates of divergent bee gut bacteria. This provides us with unique opportunities to study bacterial evolution in the gut in a simple and experimentally amenable system. The project is divided into four work packages addressing interconnected research questions of current biology: We will (i) determine the population genomic landscape of divergent gut bacteria, (ii) investigate whether bacterial diversification has resulted in competition or cooperation, (iii) discover novel mechanisms of bacterial interactions, and (iv) reveal how bacterial diversification impacts the symbiosis with the host. To this end, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining comparative metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, bee colonization experiments, microscopy, bacterial genetics, and automated bee tracking. This project situated at the forefront of microbial symbiosis will provide groundbreaking insights into microbial evolution and ecology, gut microbiology, and honey bee health and biology.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

    "project_objective": "The Land Biosphere is a critical component of the Earth System, linking to climate through multiple feedback processes. Understanding these feedback processes is a huge intellectual challenge. In part because of the pioneering work of the PI (Cox et al., 2000), many of the climate projections reported in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) now include climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. However the latest Earth System Models (ESMs) continue to show a huge range in the projected responses of the land carbon cycle over the 21st century. This uncertainty threatens to undermine the value of these projections to inform climate policy.  This project (ECCLES) is designed to produce significant reductions in the uncertainties associated with land-climate interactions, using the novel concept of Emergent Constraints - relationships between future projections and observable variations in the current Earth System that are common across the ensemble of ESMs. Emergent Constraints have many attractive features but chief amongst these is that they can make ensembles of ESMs more than the sum of the parts - allowing the full range of ESM projections to be used collectively, alongside key observations, to reduce uncertainties in the future climate. The project will deliver: (i) a theoretical foundation for Emergent Constraints; (ii) new datasets on the changing function of the land biosphere; (iii) Emergent Constraints on land-climate interactions based on observed temporal and spatial variations; (iv) a new generation of scientists expert in land-climate interactions and Emergent Constraints. ECCLES will benefit from the expertise and experience of the PI, which includes training as a theoretical physicist, an early career developing models of the land biosphere for ESMs, and a current career in a department of mathematics where he is at the forefront of efforts to develop and apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (Cox et al., 2013, Wenzel et al., 2016).",

By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

This ERC project aims at studying the multi-scale processes of this conversion from diffuse gas to stars. The fundamental data are provided by two PI-led large observing programs at two of the most advanced radio and mm interferometers, the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). This combined approach is designed to address outstanding key questions in the field of cloud and star formation.<br/>The 225 hours THOR program at the VLA investigates the cloud formation and conversion of atomic to molecular gas, as well as feedback processes back to the interstellar medium (ISM). To reach these goals, THOR observes the Milky Way in atomic HI, molecular OH, and cm continuum and radio recombination lines tracing the ionized components of the ISM.  <br/>At smaller spatial scales, the 300 hours PdBI project CORE will study the fragmentation of the gas clumps to form clusters, the formation of accretion disks and outflows, and the gas infall rates as proxy for the accretion rates. Therefore, assisted by Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations, we will investigate a sample of high-mass star-forming regions at the highest spatial resolution of 0.2'' to dissect the physical processes during the assembly of the highest mass stars. <br/>The core aim of this ERC project is to study all spatial scales from molecular clouds to individual massive cores. This will be a decisive step in the understanding of the conversion of gas and dust into stars. Through his decade-long expertise and leadership in star/cloud formation, the PI is uniquely positioned to advance the field significantly. The surveys at the heart of the program are extremely computing and work intensive accumulating data in the 100 TByte regime. This proposals asks for a strong core group of three postdocs and one PhD student to conduct the project and fully exploit the scientific results.",

However, elastic dislocation theory combined with friction laws suggests that fluid overpressure may inhibit the dynamic instabilities that result in earthquakes. This controversy poses a serious problem in our understanding of earthquake physics, with severe implications for both natural and human-induced seismic hazard. Nevertheless, currently, there are only a few systematic studies of the role of fluid pressure under controlled, laboratory conditions for which the evolution of friction parameters and slip stability can be deduced. Here I propose a comprehensive experimental study of The role of Fluid pressure in EArthquake Triggering (FEAT). The proposed work will document the evolution of fault friction parameters as a function of fluid overpressure using a world-class rock deformation apparatus. The laboratory experiments will build on the characterization of fault zone structure, fluid flow, and deformation processes, which I intend to reconstruct from careful field evaluations of ancient faults that represent exhumed analogues of seismically active structures. An important part of my work will be the interaction with the energy industry to investigate the role of fluids in induced seismicity. <br/>The experimental work will strengthen my expertise in frictional and fluid flow characterisation of fault rocks. Additionally, I will develop new skills in electronic and mechanical engineering aspects of experiments. Field and microstructural work will widen my background in the field of structural geology, microstructural analysis and model construction using energy-industry software.

However, the underlying deformation mechanisms remain ambiguous, particularly in the presence of strain gradients. In this project, we intend to develop an integrated micro-torsion and micro-tension technique with a heating and temperature-control element for investigating the mechanical behavior of micro-scale metallic wires/tubes at elevated temperatures. We study all three size effects, due to the grain size, due to nonuniform deformation, and due to the wire diameter, and their coupling effects, using samples with different diameters (or wall thickness) and controlled grain sizes. The Fellow has reported the first observation of anomalous plasticity in the cyclic torsion of micro-scale metallic wires at room temperature. However, there have been no reports on the phenomenon in the cyclic torsion of small volumes at elevated temperatures. In this proposal, we plan to perform the (cyclic) torsion tests on micron-scale metallic wires and tubes which are heated in situ by passing an electrical current, and then to analyze the relation between plastic recovery and temperature. A long term goal is to exploit the size effect in novel high-strength, lightweight materials through \u201clength-scale engineering\u201d. The main objectives are: \u2022 To integrate the different micro-torsion/tension experimental methods, and so that it can be used at high temperatures. \u2022 To perform (cyclic) torsion and tension tests on thin metallic wires/tubes at elevated temperature. \u2022 To integrate the complementary theoretical methods, used to understand the corresponding physical mechanisms for the observed phenomena. \u2022 To test existing theories for micro-scale plasticity by using the homemade samples, e.g. thin wires/tubes prepared with different grain sizes and diameters.",

Intriguingly, many, if not most, cellular compartments are not membrane enclosed. Rather, they assemble dynamically by phase separation, typically triggered upon a specific event. Despite significant progress on reconstituting such liquid-like assemblies in vitro, we lack information as to whether these compartments in vivo are indeed amorphous liquids, or whether they exhibit structural features such as gels or fibers. My recent work on sample preparation of cells for cryo-electron tomography, including cryo-focused ion beam thinning, guided by 3D correlative fluorescence microscopy, shows that we can now prepare site-specific \u2018electron-transparent windows\u2019 in suitable eukaryotic systems, which allow direct examination of structural features of cellular compartments in their cellular context.  Here, we will use these techniques to elucidate the structural principles and cytoplasmic environment driving the dynamic assembly of two phase-separated compartments: Stress granules, which are RNA bodies that form rapidly in the cytoplasm upon cellular stress, and centrosomes, which are sites of microtubule nucleation. We will combine these studies with a quantitative description of the crowded nature of cytoplasm and of its local variations, to provide a direct readout of the impact of excluded volume on molecular assembly in living cells. Taken together, these studies will provide fundamental insights into the structural basis by which cells form biochemical compartments.",

      "Serological studies of ZIKV are hampered by cross-reactive immune responses against heterologous viruses.",
      "We conducted serosurveys for ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in 633 individuals prospectively sampled during 2015 to 2016, including microcephaly and non-microcephaly pregnancies, HIV-infected patients, tuberculosis patients, and university staff in Salvador in northeastern Brazil using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and plaque reduction neutralization tests.",
      "Sera sampled retrospectively during 2013 to 2015 from 277 HIV-infected patients were used to assess the spread of ZIKV over time.",
      "Individuals were georeferenced, and sociodemographic indicators were compared between ZIKV-positive and -negative areas and areas with and without microcephaly cases.",
      "Epidemiological key parameters were modeled in a Bayesian framework.",
      "ZIKV seroprevalence increased rapidly during 2015 to 2016, reaching 63.3% by 2016 (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.4 to 66.8%), comparable to the seroprevalence of DENV (75.7%; CI, 69.4 to 81.1%) and higher than that of CHIKV (7.4%; CI, 5.6 to 9.8%).",
      "Of 19 microcephaly pregnancies, 94.7% showed ZIKV IgG antibodies, compared to 69.3% of 257 non-microcephaly pregnancies (P = 0.017).",
      "Analyses of sociodemographic data revealed a higher ZIKV burden in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas.",
      "High seroprevalence, combined with case data dynamics allowed estimates of the basic reproduction number R0 of 2.1 (CI, 1.8 to 2.5) at the onset of the outbreak and an effective reproductive number Reff of <1 in subsequent years.",
      "Our data corroborate ZIKV-associated congenital disease and an association of low SES and ZIKV infection and suggest that population immunity caused cessation of the outbreak.",
      "Similar studies from other areas will be required to determine the fate of the American ZIKV outbreak.",
      "IMPORTANCE The ongoing American Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak involves millions of cases and has a major impact on maternal and child health.",
      "Knowledge of infection rates is crucial to project future epidemic patterns and determine the absolute risk of microcephaly upon maternal ZIKV infection during pregnancy.",
      "For unknown reasons, the vast majority of ZIKV-associated microcephaly cases are concentrated in northeastern Brazil.",
      "We analyzed different subpopulations from Salvador, a Brazilian metropolis representing one of the most affected areas during the American ZIKV outbreak.",
      "We demonstrate rapid spread of ZIKV in Salvador, Brazil, and infection rates exceeding 60%.",
      "We provide evidence for the link between ZIKV and microcephaly, report that ZIKV predominantly affects geographic areas with low socioeconomic status, and show that population immunity likely caused cessation of the outbreak.",
      "Our results enable stakeholders to identify target populations for vaccination and for trials on vaccine efficacy and allow refocusing of research efforts and intervention strategies."

      "Phenotypic Differences between Asian and African Lineage Zika Viruses in Human Neural Progenitor Cells",
      "ABSTRACT",
      "Recent Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have been associated with a range of neurological complications, in particular congenital microcephaly.",
      "Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of microcephaly, and experimental ZIKV infection of hNPCs has been shown to induce cell death.",
      "However, the infection efficiency and rate of cell death have varied between studies, which might be related to intrinsic differences between African and Asian lineage ZIKV strains.",
      "Therefore, we determined the replication kinetics, including infection efficiency, burst size, and ability to induce cell death, of two Asian and two African ZIKV strains.",
      "African ZIKV strains replicated to higher titers in Vero cells, human glioblastoma (U87MG) cells, human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cells, and hNPCs than Asian ZIKV strains.",
      "Furthermore, infection with Asian ZIKV strains did not result in significant cell death early after infection, whereas infection with African ZIKV strains resulted in high percentages of cell death in hNPCs.",
      "The differences between African and Asian lineage ZIKV strains highlight the importance of including relevant ZIKV strains to study the pathogenesis of congenital microcephaly and caution against extrapolation of experimental data obtained using historical African ZIKV strains to the current outbreak.",
      "Finally, the fact that Asian ZIKV strains infect only a minority of cells with a relatively low burst size together with the lack of early cell death induction might contribute to its ability to cause chronic infections within the central nervous system (CNS).",
      "",
      "IMPORTANCE",
      "The mechanism by which ZIKV causes a range of neurological complications, especially congenital microcephaly, is not well understood.",
      "The fact that congenital microcephaly is associated with Asian lineage ZIKV strains raises the question of why this was not discovered earlier.",
      "One possible explanation is that Asian and African ZIKV strains differ in their abilities to infect cells of the CNS and to cause neurodevelopmental problems.",
      "Here, we show that Asian ZIKV strains infect and induce cell death in human neural progenitor cells\u2014which are important target cells in the development of congenital microcephaly\u2014less efficiently than African ZIKV strains.",
      "These features of Asian ZIKV strains likely contribute to their ability to cause chronic infections, often observed in congenital microcephaly cases.",
      "It is therefore likely that phenotypic differences between ZIKV strains could be, at least in part, responsible for the ability of Asian ZIKV strains to cause congenital microcephaly."

      "Vector competence can be changed dramatically by single amino acid exchanges located predominantly within the CHIKV E1 and E2 envelope proteins, which are associated with enhanced transmissibility by anthropophilic Aedes mosquitoes.",

      "Primers were designed in conserved genomic regions to allow broad usability across CHIKV genotypes.",
      "The sensitivity of both assays was at least equivalent to E1- and E2-based reference assays and robust among CHIKV genotypes at 51.4 IU/reaction (E1, 95% confidence interval [CI], 39.8 to 78.9) and 4.0 IU/reaction (E2, 95% CI, 2.0 to 7.4).",
      "Upon analysis of the complete known CHIKV genomic diversity, up to 11 nucleotide mismatches with CHIKV variants occurred under oligonucleotide binding sites of reference assays, potentially limiting assay sensitivity, whereas no critical mismatches occurred in the new assays.",

      "The combined new assays allow improved molecular epidemiological surveillance of CHIKV globally.",
      "IMPORTANCE The life cycle of arboviruses relies on efficient infection of and transmission by arthropod vectors.",
      "Adaptation to new vectors can thus dramatically increase the geographic range of an arbovirus.",
      "Several adaptive mutations enhance chikungunya virus (CHIKV) transmissibility by different mosquito species.",
      "The appearance of those adaptive mutations has led to large-scale CHIKV outbreaks in Asia, Africa, and Europe.",
      "Molecular surveillance of circulating CHIKV strains for adaptive mutations contributes to precise risk assessments and efficient vector control and provides new insight into the evolution of vector adaptation.",
      "Existing assays for molecular CHIKV surveillance are limited by poor coverage of known adaptive mutations, low sensitivity, and cost-intensive deep sequencing approaches, preventing universal application.",
      "We developed two highly sensitive nested RT-PCR assays that cover hot spots of vector adaptation in CHIKV envelope domains.",

    "project_objective": "Fluid overpressure has been proposed as one of the primary mechanisms that facilitate earthquake slip along tectonic faults. However, elastic dislocation theory combined with friction laws suggests that fluid overpressure may inhibit the dynamic instabilities that result in earthquakes. This controversy poses a serious problem in our understanding of earthquake physics, with severe implications for both natural and human-induced seismic hazard. Nevertheless, currently, there are only a few systematic studies of the role of fluid pressure under controlled, laboratory conditions for which the evolution of friction parameters and slip stability can be deduced. Here I propose a comprehensive experimental study of The role of Fluid pressure in EArthquake Triggering (FEAT). The proposed work will document the evolution of fault friction parameters as a function of fluid overpressure using a world-class rock deformation apparatus. The laboratory experiments will build on the characterization of fault zone structure, fluid flow, and deformation processes, which I intend to reconstruct from careful field evaluations of ancient faults that represent exhumed analogues of seismically active structures. An important part of my work will be the interaction with the energy industry to investigate the role of fluids in induced seismicity. <br/>The experimental work will strengthen my expertise in frictional and fluid flow characterisation of fault rocks. Additionally, I will develop new skills in electronic and mechanical engineering aspects of experiments. Field and microstructural work will widen my background in the field of structural geology, microstructural analysis and model construction using energy-industry software. These training-through-research activities will allow for the creation of unprecedented insight into the role of fluid pressure in earthquake triggering while broadening my competences via interdisciplinary studies and inter-sectorial experience.",

At the time of clinically evident arthritis and diagnosis, the disease is already persisting, requiring long-term suppressive treatment. My overarching aim is to prevent chronic arthritis and RA by inhibiting the evolving auto-immune response in a pre-arthritis phase. Currently, identification of RA-patients before the classic presentation with clinically evident chronic arthritis is beyond the state of the art. I here aim to achieve this early recognition by increasing the mechanistic understanding of pre-arthritis phases.<br/> <br/>I intend to study RA-specific auto-immune responses at the cellular and humoral level as well as markers reflecting local and systemic inflammation. These aspects are selected based on my world-wide validated rule to predict RA-development in early arthritis and on recent work on progression from Clinically Suspect Arthralgia (CSA) to clinical arthritis.<br/><br/>This project is now finally feasible, thanks to unique \u2018pre-RA\u2019 cohorts and cross-boundary preparatory work done with basic scientists, clinicians and engineers. My research concept is to integrate the products of separate trajectories in a longitudinal study and translate it to the clinic. <br/><br/>Patients with CSA will be studied serially in time. Using validated methods and novel techniques and insights we will: delineate molecular and predictive features of RA-specific auto-antibodies and auto-antibody secreting B-cells, identify improved markers of systemic inflammation and test and validate a computer-aided image analysis system to detect subclinical joint inflammation on MRI. Serial data will be combined to reveal interactions between markers and time relationships. Lastly a prediction model identifying imminent RA will be developed. The forefront position of my group allows national and international validation. <br/><br/>Together, this multidisciplinary and intersectorial project will open new horizons for preventive, targeted interventions.",

As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia.

      "We aimed to determine the feasibility of assessing the Agatston score of the descending aorta calcification (DAC) on standard coronary calcium scans and the association of this score with coronary events in a low-risk study population.",
      "Methods Between January 2008 and March 2011, 390 consecutive patients who were referred for cardiac CT as part of work-up for pulmonary vein isolation (n=115) or assessment of presence of coronary artery disease (n=275) were included.",
      "At baseline, all patients were free of a history of cardiovascular disease.",
      "Two independent observers determined the Agatston score of the ascending aorta and descending aorta.",
      "Results A total of 16 patients (4.1%) developed coronary events (acute coronary syndrome (n=6) and symptomatic significant coronary artery disease requiring treatment (n=10)) during a follow-up of 67\u00b112 months, with more events in patients with calcifications in the descending aorta than in those without (8.4% vs 3.7 %; p=0.08).",
      "Multivariable Cox regression, corrected for Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and coronary Agatston score (CAC), revealed that DAC was independently associated with coronary events (per 100 units; HR: 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09; p=0.001).",
      "DAC furthermore increased the identification of patients that will experience a coronary event (area under the curve: 0.68 for FRS only, 0.75 for FRS+CAC and 0.78 for FRS+CAC+DAC).",
      "Conclusions The Agatston score of the descending aorta could be included in the standard analysis of cardiac CT scans of low-risk patients since it holds valuable information for the prediction of coronary events."

NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present, AAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on effectiveness in small animal models. We (and others) have shown substantial progress in improving gene therapy for eye diseases in rodents. However, small animal studies are not often predictive of human outcome when it comes to the efficacy of viral delivery. Moreover, non-human primates used as pre-clinical animal models do not display any pathology making them unsuitable for testing efficacy. Here, I propose to overcome these bottlenecks in translational gene therapy by generating non-human primate models of retinal degeneration where effects of therapies and prosthesis on sight restoration can be tested. Generating transgenic primates using germline transgenesis would be very costly and ethically problematic. I thus propose to induce retinal disease locally, following delivery of pathogenic genes within specific subsets of cells in the non-human primate retina (Aim A). In Aim B, I propose to develop novel AAVs for use in human gene therapy using directed evolution. This bioengineering approach has yielded AAVs with enhanced delivery properties in the murine retina and applying it to post-mortem human retinas will generate AAVs responding to a clinical need in gene therapy. All together, the creation of models of disease in primates combined with novel AAVs tested in human post-mortem retinas will enable us to validate therapies aiming at vision restoration and neuroprotection in retinas with a macula and high central visual acuity, removing a major roadblock in the development of ocular therapeutics for humans.",

By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development.

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

    "project_objective": "Alcohol overuse is an important societal challenge with annual healthcare costs of over \u20ac22 billion in Europe. Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia.

As adherent cells also read their environment through substrate interactions there is a great interest in developing such substrates in a predictable manner. Their first point of contact is through their focal adhesions and it is also though them that forces are applied allowing the cell to migrate and establish cytoskeletal tension which in turn regulates cell function. The objective of this project is to investigate the cell-substrate interaction at the nanoscale and correlate that to the surface topography for predictable biomaterials. Through the application of state-of-the-art nanofabrication we will fabricate precise surface topographies with length scales comparable to the structural units found in the focal adhesions. The aim is to map and understand the topographical influence in the architectural arrangement of the proteins in the adhesions. Aided by high resolution microscopy we will classify cell types on different nanotopographies. Combining that information with machine learning, we will be able to gain information about cell characteristics from the rule set. That information can also be used in reverse to identify cell types with the previously defined characteristic.

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

As such, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and effective prevention and treatment strategies. As numerous clinical trials have shown, lifestyle modification is by far the best way to prevent these diseases, with lifestyle being twice as effective as the best drugs, less costly and free from side effects. Yet, human biology is complex, causing some people to respond well and others poorly to the same lifestyle interventions. Thus, a huge, as yet unrealised opportunity exists to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases by tailoring lifestyle interventions to the patient\u2019s unique biology. <br/>NASCENT is an integrated programme of research through which I will functionally annotate and later translate discoveries of gene-lifestyle interactions made through the interrogation of large epidemiological (N>100,000) datasets at my disposal. The functional annotation of these discoveries will be done using state-of-the-art epigenomic and targeted gene editing tools, whereas the translation of those findings will be achieved using a innovative and powerful clinical trial design that focuses on treatments that are tailored to the participant\u2019s genotype (genotype-based recall). <br/>NASCENT capitalizes on a solid foundation of cohorts, methods, and expertise that I have built-up over the past fifteen years, but also exploits state-of-the-art epigenomic and gene-editing technologies that have not previously been used in studies of gene-lifestyle interactions. I expect the integration of these established and new approaches in NASCENT to propel major advances in understanding gene-lifestyle interactions in cardiometabolic disease that help optimise disease prevention.",

By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present, AAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on effectiveness in small animal models. We (and others) have shown substantial progress in improving gene therapy for eye diseases in rodents. However, small animal studies are not often predictive of human outcome when it comes to the efficacy of viral delivery. Moreover, non-human primates used as pre-clinical animal models do not display any pathology making them unsuitable for testing efficacy. Here, I propose to overcome these bottlenecks in translational gene therapy by generating non-human primate models of retinal degeneration where effects of therapies and prosthesis on sight restoration can be tested. Generating transgenic primates using germline transgenesis would be very costly and ethically problematic. I thus propose to induce retinal disease locally, following delivery of pathogenic genes within specific subsets of cells in the non-human primate retina (Aim A). In Aim B, I propose to develop novel AAVs for use in human gene therapy using directed evolution. This bioengineering approach has yielded AAVs with enhanced delivery properties in the murine retina and applying it to post-mortem human retinas will generate AAVs responding to a clinical need in gene therapy. All together, the creation of models of disease in primates combined with novel AAVs tested in human post-mortem retinas will enable us to validate therapies aiming at vision restoration and neuroprotection in retinas with a macula and high central visual acuity, removing a major roadblock in the development of ocular therapeutics for humans.",

Understanding such variations requires insights from the past. However, no data sets of past climate are available to study decadal variability of large-scale climate with state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Currently available data sets are limited to statistical reconstructions of local or regional surface climate. The PALAEO-RA project will produce the first ever comprehensive, 3-dimensional, physically consistent reconstruction of the global climate system at a monthly scale for the past six centuries. This palaeoreanalysis is based on combining information from early instrumental measurements, historical documents (e.g. capitalizing on large amounts of newly available data from China), and proxies (e.g. tree rings) with a large ensemble of climate model simulations. To achieve this novel combination, a completely new data assimilation system for palaeoclimatological data will be developed. The unique data sets produced in this project will become reference data sets for studying past climatic variations (i) for diagnostic studies of interannual-to-decadal variability, (ii) as a benchmark for model simulations and (iii) for climate impact studies. Using the data produced, the project will analyse episodes of slowed or accelerated global warming, decadal subtropical drought periods, episodes of expanding or contracting tropics, slowed or strengthened monsoons, changes in storm tracks, blocking and associated weather extremes, and links between Arctic and midlatitude climate. The analyses will provide new insights into the processes governing decadal variability of weather and climate.",

Understanding and modelling circulation changes in a warming climate therefore constitutes an emerging challenge for climate science. General circulation models still struggle to represent important features of the large-scale circulation in the present-day climate, which undermines confidence in future projections. <br/>The present project is to combine a small-scale process-level with a large-scale dynamical perspective to investigate how drag processes at the Earth's surface associated with boundary-layer turbulence, orography and gravity waves affect large-scale circulation. Our aim is to develop a climatological view of the distribution and variability of individual components of surface drag as represented in general circulation models and to understand which processes or model parametrisations are responsible for current model biases especially in the representation of mid-latitude storm tracks.",

This capability will deliver innovative climate science and a new generation of advanced Earth System Models. Sector-specific end-users in policy and business will be identified and engaged individually, with iterative feedback, to ensure that new climate information is tailored, actionable and strengthening societal risk management decisions.<br/>These goals will be achieved through the development of coupled GCMs from seven groups across Europe, with sufficient resolution to reproduce realistic weather and climate features (~25km mesh size), in addition to enhanced process parameterisation. Thorough assessment will use innovative process-based metrics and the latest observational and reanalysis datasets. Targeted experimental design will reduce inter-model spread and produce robust projections, forming the European contribution to the CMIP6 High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, led by PRIMAVERA. <br/>It is the first time that high-resolution coupled GCMs will be used under a single experimental protocol. Coordination, and the underlying process-understanding, will significantly increase the robustness of our findings. Our new capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the drivers of variability and change in European climate, including extremes, since such regional changes continue to be characterised by high uncertainty. <br/>We will also explore the frontiers of climate modelling and of high performance computing to produce simulations with a reduced reliance on physical parameterisations. These will explicitly resolve key processes such as ocean eddies, and will include new stochastic parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes. These \u201cfrontiers\u201d simulations will further our understanding of the robustness of climate projections.",

This will cement EU science as the world-leader in understanding climate sensitivity and climate variability, deliver significantly improved capability to make climate projections for the next 20-50 years, and provide up-to-date scientific evidence for international climate policy in two phases: Phase 1 will deliver a timely characterisation of physical science uncertainty and how it affects projections and committed levels of warming to the 2021 IPCC sixth assessment report; Phase 2 will deliver constrained surface temperature projections for the 2023 UNFCCC Global Stocktake. CONSTRAIN will take full advantage of climate model integrations from the sixth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and will leverage existing H2020 and ERC projects. Novel CMIP6 analyses will be combined with dedicated high resolution simulations and new observations to address identified knowledge gaps on radiative forcing, cloud feedbacks and the relationship between ocean variability and atmospheric change. A fourth identified knowledge gap is the effective translation of new physical science understanding into an improved evidence base for policy decisions. CONSTRAIN will address this by developing climate model emulators that integrate and operationalise learning from across the consortium to provide new capability to assess impacts of climate change under a broad range of emission scenarios. We will focus on the expected spatially resolved decadal changes until mid-century providing robust evidence on climate sensitivity, and regional temperature, precipitation and circulation changes, thereby enabling evidence-based policy decisions that will directly benefit the EU's adaptation and mitigation strategy.",

    "project_objective": "The proof of concept underlying uPROPHET rests on the EPLORE findings that capillary electrophoresis coupled with high-resolution mass-spectroscopy reproducibly identified unique urinary proteomic (UP) signatures associated with subclinical left ventricular dysfunction, renal impairment and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Consensus criteria currently applied for the selection of patients for heart transplantation (HTx) leave an inconvenient margin of uncertainty, because of the unpredictable course of the disease and the shortage of donor hearts. Furthermore, monitoring graft function and adjusting immunosuppression remain major challenges after HTx. Endomyocardial biopsies, up to 20 in the first year after HTx, are the standard approach to detect graft rejection, but require an invasive risk-carrying procedure. uPROPHET aims to develop UP profiling: (1) as a prognostic tool helpful in selecting terminally ill heart failure patients for HTx with the greatest probability of survival while adding a maximum of high-quality years to life; and (2) as an instrument to monitor graft performance and immune system activity and to manage immunosuppression. The new UP classifiers will be initially validated by demonstrating analogy between the proteomic profiles in urine and tissue samples of explanted hearts. uPROPHET will show case the translation of state-of-the-art technology into \u201cinnovative services\u201d, broaden the indications for UP, and therefore have a major impact on the plans of the business partner measuring the UP profiles. The evident benefit for the customer (patient) is the early and non-invasive stratification of risk in heart failure patients before and after HTx, hence allowing an early, personalised, and targeted approach. Clinical implementation of uPROPHET findings will bring European research to the forefront of the highly competitive fields of biomarker research and personalised medicine and impact on transplantation medicine beyond HTx.",

    "project_objective": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord affecting some 40,000 individuals in Europe, causing 11,000 deaths each year. Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Exploring this big health data promises to reveal new insights into disease mechanisms and therapy outcomes. Ultimately, the goal is to exploit these insights for Precision Medicine, which hopes to offer personalized preventive care and therapy selection for each patient. <br/>A technology with transformational potential in analysing this health data is Machine Learning. Machine Learning strives to discover new knowledge in form of statistical dependencies in large datasets. Mining health data is, however, not a simple direct application of established machine learning techniques. On the contrary, the emerging population-scale and ultra-high dimensionality of health data creates the need to develop Machine Learning algorithms that can successfully operate at this scale. Overcoming these frontiers in Machine Learning is key to making the vision of Precision Medicine a reality.<br/>To meet this challenge, Europe urgently needs a new generation of scientists with knowledge in both machine learning and in health data analysis, who are extremely rare at a global scale. Our ETN\u2019s goal is to close this gap, by bringing together leading European research institutes in Machine Learning and Statistical Genetics, both from the private and public sector, to train 14 early stage researchers. These scientists will help to shape the future of this important topic and increase Europe\u2019s competitiveness in this domain, which will have severe academic and industrial impact in the future and has the potential to shape the healthcare and high tech sector in Europe in the 21st century.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

Consensus criteria currently applied for the selection of patients for heart transplantation (HTx) leave an inconvenient margin of uncertainty, because of the unpredictable course of the disease and the shortage of donor hearts. Furthermore, monitoring graft function and adjusting immunosuppression remain major challenges after HTx. Endomyocardial biopsies, up to 20 in the first year after HTx, are the standard approach to detect graft rejection, but require an invasive risk-carrying procedure. uPROPHET aims to develop UP profiling: (1) as a prognostic tool helpful in selecting terminally ill heart failure patients for HTx with the greatest probability of survival while adding a maximum of high-quality years to life; and (2) as an instrument to monitor graft performance and immune system activity and to manage immunosuppression. The new UP classifiers will be initially validated by demonstrating analogy between the proteomic profiles in urine and tissue samples of explanted hearts. uPROPHET will show case the translation of state-of-the-art technology into \u201cinnovative services\u201d, broaden the indications for UP, and therefore have a major impact on the plans of the business partner measuring the UP profiles.

An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates. Our research has the potential to facilitate the generation of specific tissues from different cellular contexts for future biomedical approaches.",

As such, there is an urgent need to develop innovative and effective prevention and treatment strategies. As numerous clinical trials have shown, lifestyle modification is by far the best way to prevent these diseases, with lifestyle being twice as effective as the best drugs, less costly and free from side effects. Yet, human biology is complex, causing some people to respond well and others poorly to the same lifestyle interventions. Thus, a huge, as yet unrealised opportunity exists to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases by tailoring lifestyle interventions to the patient\u2019s unique biology. <br/>NASCENT is an integrated programme of research through which I will functionally annotate and later translate discoveries of gene-lifestyle interactions made through the interrogation of large epidemiological (N>100,000) datasets at my disposal. The functional annotation of these discoveries will be done using state-of-the-art epigenomic and targeted gene editing tools, whereas the translation of those findings will be achieved using a innovative and powerful clinical trial design that focuses on treatments that are tailored to the participant\u2019s genotype (genotype-based recall). <br/>NASCENT capitalizes on a solid foundation of cohorts, methods, and expertise that I have built-up over the past fifteen years, but also exploits state-of-the-art epigenomic and gene-editing technologies that have not previously been used in studies of gene-lifestyle interactions. I expect the integration of these established and new approaches in NASCENT to propel major advances in understanding gene-lifestyle interactions in cardiometabolic disease that help optimise disease prevention.",

Consensus criteria currently applied for the selection of patients for heart transplantation (HTx) leave an inconvenient margin of uncertainty, because of the unpredictable course of the disease and the shortage of donor hearts. Furthermore, monitoring graft function and adjusting immunosuppression remain major challenges after HTx. Endomyocardial biopsies, up to 20 in the first year after HTx, are the standard approach to detect graft rejection, but require an invasive risk-carrying procedure. uPROPHET aims to develop UP profiling: (1) as a prognostic tool helpful in selecting terminally ill heart failure patients for HTx with the greatest probability of survival while adding a maximum of high-quality years to life; and (2) as an instrument to monitor graft performance and immune system activity and to manage immunosuppression. The new UP classifiers will be initially validated by demonstrating analogy between the proteomic profiles in urine and tissue samples of explanted hearts. uPROPHET will show case the translation of state-of-the-art technology into \u201cinnovative services\u201d, broaden the indications for UP, and therefore have a major impact on the plans of the business partner measuring the UP profiles. The evident benefit for the customer (patient) is the early and non-invasive stratification of risk in heart failure patients before and after HTx, hence allowing an early, personalised, and targeted approach. Clinical implementation of uPROPHET findings will bring European research to the forefront of the highly competitive fields of biomarker research and personalised medicine and impact on transplantation medicine beyond HTx.",

Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

      "The aims of this study were to examine if changes could also be seen in the CSF for secreted metabolites of APP-like protein 1 (APLP1) and to explore the prognostic value of amyloid-related CSF biomarkers, as well as markers of neuronal injury and astroglial activation, as regards to clinical outcome after shunt surgery.",
      "METHODS: Twenty patients diagnosed with iNPH, 10 improved and 10 unchanged by shunt surgery, and 20 neurologically healthy controls were included.",

    "project_objective": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord affecting some 40,000 individuals in Europe, causing 11,000 deaths each year. Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "project_objective": "Alcohol overuse is an important societal challenge with annual healthcare costs of over \u20ac22 billion in Europe. Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

      "Results VirMiner achieved 41.06%\u2009\u00b1\u200917.51% sensitivity and 81.91%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.04% specificity in the prediction of phage contigs.",
      "In particular, for the high-abundance phage contigs, VirMiner outperformed other tools (VirFinder and VirSorter) with much higher sensitivity (65.23%\u2009\u00b1\u200916.94%) than VirFinder (34.63%\u2009\u00b1\u200917.96%) and VirSorter (18.75%\u2009\u00b1\u200915.23%) at almost the same specificity.",
      "Moreover, VirMiner provides the most comprehensive phage analysis pipeline which is comprised of metagenomic raw reads processing, functional annotation, phage contig identification, and phage-host relationship prediction (CRISPR-spacer recognition) and supports two-group comparison when the input (metagenomic sequence data) includes different conditions (e.g., case and control).",
      "Application of VirMiner to an independent cohort of human gut metagenomes obtained from individuals treated with antibiotics revealed that 122 KEGG orthology and 118 Pfam groups had significantly differential abundance in the pre-treatment samples compared to samples at the end of antibiotic administration, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), multidrug resistance, and protein transport.",
      "The VirMiner webserver is available at http://sbb.hku.hk/VirMiner/.",
      "Conclusions We developed a comprehensive tool for phage prediction and analysis for metagenomic samples.",

ZIKAlliance will addrees three key objectives relating to (i) impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy and short & medium term effects on newborns, (ii) associated natural history of ZIKV infection in humans and their environment in the context of other circulating arboviruses and (iii) building the overall capacity for preparedness research for future epidemic threats in Latin America & the Caribbean. The project will take advantage of large standardised clinical cohorts of pregnant women and febrile patients in regions of Latin America and the Caribbean were the virus is circulating, expanding a preexisting network established by the IDAMS EU project. I will also benefit of a very strong expertise in basic and environmental sciences, with access to both field work and sophisticated technological infrastructures to characterise virus replication and physiopathology mechanisms. To meet its 3 key objectives, the scientific project has been organised in 9 work packages, with WP2/3 dedicated to clinical research (cohorts, clinical biology, epidemiology & modeling), WP3/4 to basic research (virology & antivirals, pathophysiology & animal models), WP5/6 to environmental research (animal reservoirs, vectors & vector control) , WP7/8 to social sciences & communication, and WP9 to management. The broad consortium set-up allow gathering the necessary expertise for an actual interdisciplinary approach, and operating in a range of countries with contrasting ZIKV epidemiological status.\"",

    "project_objective": "Alcohol overuse is an important societal challenge with annual healthcare costs of over \u20ac22 billion in Europe. Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

The aging population and the dramatically increasing age of parenthood are associated with grave medical problems, declining reproductive health, and severe consequences for the socio-economic well-being of our societies. These proboems will impact the demographic structure and societal welfare in the European population. Thus the urgent need to understand the biological basis and to identify risk factors and pathways of the steep age-dependent decline in female and male germ cell quality. GermAge will address mostly the aging female gametogenesis known to be most severely affected by aging, but also the important contribution of aging male germ cells to age-related fertility and inheritance problems. The decay of key chromosome proteins such as cohesins, the failure of quality control mechanisms such as the spindle assembly checkpoint, and the mutation load in aging spermatogonial stem cells are among the highly synergetic research topics of GermAge. Mouse and human germ cells will be analyzed by high-end and innovative techniques. The expected insights will eventually lead to much improved diagnostics in various reproductive medicine procedures such as quality control of germ cells frozen for delayed in vitro fertilization, development of new biomarkers for oocytes, risk assessment for inherited diseases including aneuploidie in carriers of specific mutations, and prognosis based on individualized genomics on age-related quality decline of oocytes and spermatocytes. We also expect that our findings will raise awareness of the risks associated with postponing parenthood, leading to a much-needed prioritization on the public health agenda.",

By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

    "project_objective": "Alcohol overuse is an important societal challenge with annual healthcare costs of over \u20ac22 billion in Europe. Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

Despite the importance of gut microbiomes for host health, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. There is evidence that the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome has emerged through the diversification of a few founder lineages. However, how lineages have diversified into discrete species and which underlying mechanisms maintain the diversity in the gut remains elusive. The current project will address these questions by studying the gut microbiome of honey bees. We have recently found that the eight dominant bacterial lineages in the honey bee gut have substantially diversified, which is a striking parallelism to the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome. Moreover, we have established experiments to colonize microbiota-free bees with cultured isolates of divergent bee gut bacteria. This provides us with unique opportunities to study bacterial evolution in the gut in a simple and experimentally amenable system. The project is divided into four work packages addressing interconnected research questions of current biology: We will (i) determine the population genomic landscape of divergent gut bacteria, (ii) investigate whether bacterial diversification has resulted in competition or cooperation, (iii) discover novel mechanisms of bacterial interactions, and (iv) reveal how bacterial diversification impacts the symbiosis with the host. To this end, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining comparative metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, bee colonization experiments, microscopy, bacterial genetics, and automated bee tracking. This project situated at the forefront of microbial symbiosis will provide groundbreaking insights into microbial evolution and ecology, gut microbiology, and honey bee health and biology.",

By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

Consensus criteria currently applied for the selection of patients for heart transplantation (HTx) leave an inconvenient margin of uncertainty, because of the unpredictable course of the disease and the shortage of donor hearts. Furthermore, monitoring graft function and adjusting immunosuppression remain major challenges after HTx. Endomyocardial biopsies, up to 20 in the first year after HTx, are the standard approach to detect graft rejection, but require an invasive risk-carrying procedure. uPROPHET aims to develop UP profiling: (1) as a prognostic tool helpful in selecting terminally ill heart failure patients for HTx with the greatest probability of survival while adding a maximum of high-quality years to life; and (2) as an instrument to monitor graft performance and immune system activity and to manage immunosuppression. The new UP classifiers will be initially validated by demonstrating analogy between the proteomic profiles in urine and tissue samples of explanted hearts. uPROPHET will show case the translation of state-of-the-art technology into \u201cinnovative services\u201d, broaden the indications for UP, and therefore have a major impact on the plans of the business partner measuring the UP profiles. The evident benefit for the customer (patient) is the early and non-invasive stratification of risk in heart failure patients before and after HTx, hence allowing an early, personalised, and targeted approach. Clinical implementation of uPROPHET findings will bring European research to the forefront of the highly competitive fields of biomarker research and personalised medicine and impact on transplantation medicine beyond HTx.",

    "project_objective": "Critical to our understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and also to finding therapies is determining how key pathological factors interact and relate to neuronal toxicity, symptoms and disease progression. My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic.

    "project_objective": "Alcohol overuse is an important societal challenge with annual healthcare costs of over \u20ac22 billion in Europe. Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

    "project_objective": "The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains makes tuberculosis (TB) a key priority for infectious disease research. Inflammation and autophagy are two fundamental processes critical to TB pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence shows that TB disease is worsened by deregulation of the inflammatory response. On the other hand, autophagy has recently emerged as a crucial host defence mechanism. Autophagy counteracts the ability of mycobacteria to survive inside host cells and targets them for degradation. Autophagy is also thought to control the inflammatory response. However, the interaction between inflammation and autophagy in host defence against TB remains unclear. The aim of my proposal is to use the well-established zebrafish model of TB to gain insight into this key question. Recently, the host laboratory discovered that the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM1) protects against TB in the zebrafish model. They also implicated this important autophagy regulator in inflammation, as it strongly affects expression of interleukin-1beta (IL1B). I have specific expertise in studying IL1B-mediated inflammation in zebrafish. Thus the proposed project will be a great synergy between me and the host laboratory, which is leading in zebrafish infectious disease research. I will determine how modulation of autophagy or manipulation of IL1B levels reciprocally influence each other during TB disease. The zebrafish model provides excellent tools to visualize these processes in vivo. Furthermore, I will take advantage of the host\u2019s expertise in RNA sequencing and proteomics to study genome-wide effects of autophagy modulation on the inflammatory response. A secondment will allow me to compare results in the TB model with a damage-induced inflammation model. The project will provide new insights into regulatory pathways that could potentially be intervened in treatment of TB or other inflammatory diseases with common characteristics.",

Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

Despite their importance, all proposed molecular models for transport are based on indirect evidence due to the inability of classical biophysical and biochemical techniques to directly visualize dynamic structural changes. To solve this problem, I suggest a novel approach that can decipher the molecular mechanisms of transport, with the ultimate goal to use this knowledge against pathogenic bacteria, for treatment of ABC-related diseases or multi-drug resistance of cancer cells.<br/>I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy for the study of conformational states of an ABC model system in vitro, and thus to observe directly how elementary transport steps are coordinated. This will open up a virtually unexplored biophysical research area and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC transporters. The key questions of this proposal are:<br/><br/>Aim 1: What is the mechanism of substrate binding in ABC transporters? The conformational equilibrium (open vs. closed state) of ABC-associated substrate-binding proteins will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism of binding, i.e. induced fit vs. conformational selection.<br/><br/>Aim 2: What are relevant conformational states and changes for substrate translocation? The time- and length-scales of conformational changes in transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains as well as interactions with other domains will be characterized using the osmoregulator OpuA as a model system.<br/><br/>Aim 3: How are substrate binding, energy utilization and translocation coordinated in ABC transporters? Finally, a complete model of transport will be developed to decipher the coordination of transport events, i.e. how substrate binding and ATP-hydrolysis are coupled and transferred into conformational changes that drive substrate transport.",

These proboems will impact the demographic structure and societal welfare in the European population. Thus the urgent need to understand the biological basis and to identify risk factors and pathways of the steep age-dependent decline in female and male germ cell quality. GermAge will address mostly the aging female gametogenesis known to be most severely affected by aging, but also the important contribution of aging male germ cells to age-related fertility and inheritance problems. The decay of key chromosome proteins such as cohesins, the failure of quality control mechanisms such as the spindle assembly checkpoint, and the mutation load in aging spermatogonial stem cells are among the highly synergetic research topics of GermAge. Mouse and human germ cells will be analyzed by high-end and innovative techniques. The expected insights will eventually lead to much improved diagnostics in various reproductive medicine procedures such as quality control of germ cells frozen for delayed in vitro fertilization, development of new biomarkers for oocytes, risk assessment for inherited diseases including aneuploidie in carriers of specific mutations, and prognosis based on individualized genomics on age-related quality decline of oocytes and spermatocytes.

The need for predicting eco-evolutionary impacts of plastic and evolutionary responses to changing environments is still hampered by lack of strong experimental evidence. FluctEvol aims at shedding a new light on population responses to stochastic environments, and facilitating their prediction, using a unique combination of approaches. First, theoretical models of evolution and demography under a randomly changing optimum phenotype will be designed and analysed, producing new quantitative predictions. Second, statistical methodologies will be developed, and employed in meta-analyses of long-term datasets from natural populations. And third, large-scale and automated experimental evolution in stochastic environments will be carried out with the micro-alga Dunaliella salina, an extremophile that thrives at high and variable salinities. We will manipulate the magnitude and predictability of fluctuations in salinity, and use high-throughput phenotyping and candidate-gene sequencing to analyse the evolution of plasticity for traits involved in salinity adaptation in this species: glycerol and carotene content. We will thus combine the benefits of experimental evolution in microbes (short generations, ample replication) with a priori knowledge of ecologically relevant adaptive traits, allowing for hypothesis-driven experiments. The success of this project in increasing our predictive power about eco-evolutionary dynamics is warranted by the experience of the PI, at the interface between theoretical and empirical approaches. Our experiments will have relevance beyond academia, as we will modify through evolution the plasticity of traits (accumulation of energetic cell metabolites) that are direct targets for bioindustry, thus potentially overcoming current limitations in productivity.",

    "project_objective": "Regenerating tissues by reprogramming cells has the potential to become a therapeutic approach for replacing lost tissues in patients suffering from injury or degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Muscular Dystrophy. Strategies to generate required tissues using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are associated with either ethical or medical safety issues. An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates. Our research has the potential to facilitate the generation of specific tissues from different cellular contexts for future biomedical approaches.",

By being a major cause of stroke, dementia, heart failure, and premature death, AF is a major threat to healthy ageing. Despite increasing knowledge on the diverse mechanisms that cause the AF substrate in individual patients, current strategies for prevention and therapy of AF remain largely unguided by mechanistic insights. As a result - with the exception of anticoagulation for the prevention of AF-related stroke \u2013 treatment of AF has thus far failed to improve patients\u2019 outcome. <br/>The CATCH ME consortium will bridge the present disconnect between our understanding of the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of AF and the current unstructured approach to its prevention and treatment. The consortium combines clinical, molecular, ECG engineering, and biostatistical expertise, and has access to large sets of human biological material (atrial tissue and bloods samples) and carefully phenotyped patient populations. Together, we will identify and integrate the main drivers of prevalent and incident AF in patients, and validate new ECG- and blood based markers in well-characterized cohorts. The results of these investigations will provide a quantitative estimate of the prevalence and impact of new and established risk factors for AF in Europe and uncover potential new targets and strategies for the prevention and treatment of this arrhythmia. We will integrate these factors into a new clinical classification of AF that will be externally validated in two large patient cohorts, including response to current treatment strategies, and AF-related complications. In summary, CATCH ME will <br/>1. identify major AF-related modifiers of health in the elderly in Europe, <br/>2. develop clinical tools that have the potential of transforming the management of AF in individual patients, and <br/>3. inform future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF in Europe.",

Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology.

Yet, human biology is complex, causing some people to respond well and others poorly to the same lifestyle interventions. Thus, a huge, as yet unrealised opportunity exists to optimize the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases by tailoring lifestyle interventions to the patient\u2019s unique biology. <br/>NASCENT is an integrated programme of research through which I will functionally annotate and later translate discoveries of gene-lifestyle interactions made through the interrogation of large epidemiological (N>100,000) datasets at my disposal. The functional annotation of these discoveries will be done using state-of-the-art epigenomic and targeted gene editing tools, whereas the translation of those findings will be achieved using a innovative and powerful clinical trial design that focuses on treatments that are tailored to the participant\u2019s genotype (genotype-based recall). <br/>NASCENT capitalizes on a solid foundation of cohorts, methods, and expertise that I have built-up over the past fifteen years, but also exploits state-of-the-art epigenomic and gene-editing technologies that have not previously been used in studies of gene-lifestyle interactions. I expect the integration of these established and new approaches in NASCENT to propel major advances in understanding gene-lifestyle interactions in cardiometabolic disease that help optimise disease prevention.",

    "project_objective": "Strongly associated with the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that are testing healthcare systems worldwide, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly common cause of advanced liver disease in the aging population of Europe. NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

Yet, the underlying principles that guide this evolutionary response are poorly understood, in particular with regards to understanding the impact of multidrug treatment.  <br/>LimitMDR will characterize evolutionary trajectories leading to multidrug resistance in response to individual and combination drug treatment through the execution of large-scale adaptive evolution experiment with two bacterial pathogens followed by genome sequencing and phenotyping. This effort will enable testing of contrasting hypotheses regarding the evolution of multidrug resistance in response to combination treatment.   <br/><br/>We will characterize the cause-and-effect of resistance and sensitivity mutations identified in our global data set and map comprehensive fitness landscapes of mutations accumulated during drug resistance evolution to understand the evolutionary dynamics underlying resistance evolution. To accomplish these bold goals we shall develop novel multiplexed methodologies enabling unprecedented scale of construction and phenotypic testing of identified mutations. While genetic epistasis is considered of key importance to resistance evolution most studies focus on mutations within an individual gene. Through the development of a novel experimental approach we shall elucidate complex epistatic interaction networks between mutations accumulated during resistance evolution. <br/><br/>Finally, we will conduct mechanistic studies to uncover the mechanisms of collateral sensitivity. These studies will shed light on this underappreciated phenomenon, which is of critical relevance to drug discovery and the evolution of drug resistance.

In non-human primates, a single dose of VSV-ZEBOV elicited a strong (100%) and long-lasting protective efficacy against Ebola Zaire infections. Developed by Public Health Canada and manufactured by NewLink Genetics, VSV-ZEBOV was thus selected by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the 2 most promising vaccine candidates. To accelerate its clinical development, the WHO has organized a consortium and supported the organization of parallel first-in-man Phase I/II clinical trials, both in Europe and Africa. The primary objectives of these trials, initiated mid-November 2014, are to study the safety and antibody-inducing capacity of various doses of VSV-ZEBOV in European and African populations.<br/><br/>We propose to build upon this asset to acquire new and critical knowledge of the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited in humans by VSV-ZEBOV vaccination, with specific emphasis on trancriptomics and metabolomics signatures. To this aim, we have constructed a consortium including representatives from the vaccine manufacturer, scientists of the 3 main clinical sites (Switzerland, Gabon, Kenya) and world-leaders in immunology and partners of ADITEC, a large FP7- supported collaborative research programme aiming to accelerate the development of novel, powerful immunisation technologies for next-generation vaccines. We propose an ambitious program using cutting-edge technologies to perform an in depth characterization of the clinical samples harvested before/after VSV-ZEBOV immunization of 200 volunteers in Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya, and to extend the recently initiated clinical studies up to 12 months to identify the signatures and determinants of persistent immune responses.",

Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals.

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

My research has focussed on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) moities and demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b242 correlates with cerebral A\u03b2 pathology; that A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain 10-20 years prior to onset of symptoms; and that CSF A\u03b2 abnormalities precede CSF tau changes. However, it is increasingly clear that a simple linear model of AD aetiology and progression is inadequate. This proposal aims at developing and validating new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker tools to examine the AD pathogenesis in humans taking a broad view of AD\u2019s multiple pathophysiological features and their putative biomarkers. The major questions, all relevant to therapeutic research, that will be addressed in my proposal include: (i) how are different forms of A\u03b2 produced and modified; (ii) what is the toxicity of these different forms; (iii) how is this toxicity mediated; and iv) what other pathologies may contribute to or modify AD-like phenotypes? We and others have shown that A\u03b2 monomers are relatively non-toxic. We will address the hypothesis that A\u03b2 starts to accumulate in the brains of certain individuals due to defective clearance of the peptide. Once aggregated, A\u03b2 acquires chemical modifications during brain incubation over years. These modified A\u03b2 forms then induce tau hyperphosphorylation and concomitantly over-activate the immune system, resulting in neurotoxicity. Other pathologies, including \u03b1-synuclein and TDP-43, may contribute in this process. In PATHAD, we will develop and validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools using a combination of groundbreaking technologies and unique clinical materials to dissect the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AD in much greater detail than what has been possible before and facilitate the development of effective treatments.",

BREAKBEN will achieve a revolution in neuroimaging; we aim at breaking the barrier for measurement of neuronal currents by ULF MRI (neural current imaging; NCI) as well as breaking the nonuniqueness barrier for magnetoencephalography (MEG) by combining it with ULF MRI and accurately presented a priori information. A key aspect in utilizing the a priori information is injected current density imaging (CDI), which will inform us about the individual conductivity structure of the head. Using novel verification and validation approaches, we will demonstrate the unique advantages of these multimodal techniques. These breakthroughs will result in completely different workflows in brain imaging, also suitable for clinical use. We believe that we are at the edge of a qualitative technology jump with ULF MRI, its applications and combinations. This will lead to a wealth of new applications and revolutionize the way we do magnetism-based measurements of the nervous system. Europe has the unique chance to lead this revolution.",

      "Bispectral analysis is a signal processing technique that makes it possible to capture the non-linear and non-Gaussian properties of the EEG signals.",
      "It has found various applications in EEG research and clinical practice, including the assessment of anesthetic depth, the identification of epileptic seizures, and more recently, the evaluation of non-linear cross-frequency brain functional connectivity.",
      "However, the validity and reliability of the indices drawn from bispectral analysis of EEG signals are potentially biased by the use of a non-neutral EEG reference.",
      "The present study aims at investigating the effects of the reference choice on the analysis of the non-linear features of EEG signals through bicoherence, as well as on the estimation of cross-frequency EEG connectivity through two different non-linear measures, i.e., the cross-bicoherence and the antisymmetric cross-bicoherence.",
      "To this end, four commonly used reference schemes were considered: the vertex electrode (Cz), the digitally linked mastoids, the average reference, and the Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST).",
      "The reference effects were assessed both in simulations and in a real EEG experiment.",
      "The simulations allowed to investigated: (i) the effects of the electrode density on the performance of the above references in the estimation of bispectral measures; and (ii) the effects of the head model accuracy in the performance of the REST.",
      "For real data, the EEG signals recorded from 10 subjects during eyes open resting state were examined, and the distortions induced by the reference choice in the patterns of alpha-beta bicoherence, cross-bicoherence, and antisymmetric cross-bicoherence were assessed.",
      "The results showed significant differences in the findings depending on the chosen reference, with the REST providing superior performance than all the other references in approximating the ideal neutral reference.",
      "In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of considering the effects of the reference choice in the interpretation and comparison of the results of bispectral analysis of scalp EEG."

    "project_objective": "Gene therapy using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors has shown early promise in clinical trials. The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present, AAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on effectiveness in small animal models. We (and others) have shown substantial progress in improving gene therapy for eye diseases in rodents. However, small animal studies are not often predictive of human outcome when it comes to the efficacy of viral delivery. Moreover, non-human primates used as pre-clinical animal models do not display any pathology making them unsuitable for testing efficacy. Here, I propose to overcome these bottlenecks in translational gene therapy by generating non-human primate models of retinal degeneration where effects of therapies and prosthesis on sight restoration can be tested. Generating transgenic primates using germline transgenesis would be very costly and ethically problematic. I thus propose to induce retinal disease locally, following delivery of pathogenic genes within specific subsets of cells in the non-human primate retina (Aim A). In Aim B, I propose to develop novel AAVs for use in human gene therapy using directed evolution. This bioengineering approach has yielded AAVs with enhanced delivery properties in the murine retina and applying it to post-mortem human retinas will generate AAVs responding to a clinical need in gene therapy. All together, the creation of models of disease in primates combined with novel AAVs tested in human post-mortem retinas will enable us to validate therapies aiming at vision restoration and neuroprotection in retinas with a macula and high central visual acuity, removing a major roadblock in the development of ocular therapeutics for humans.",

      "Alternans is typically linked to oscillation of calcium cycling, particularly in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).",
      "While the role of SR calcium reuptake in alternans is well established, the role of altered calcium release by ryanodine receptors has not yet been studied extensively.",
      "At the same time, there is strong evidence that calcium release is abnormal in heart failure and other heart diseases, suggesting that these changes might play a pro-alternans role.",
      "Aims To demonstrate how changes to intracellular calcium release dynamics and magnitude affect alternans vulnerability.",
      "Methods We used the state-of-the-art Heijman\u2013Rudy and O\u2019Hara\u2013Rudy computer models of ventricular myocyte, given their detailed representation of calcium handling and their previous utility in alternans research.",
      "We modified the models to obtain precise control over SR release dynamics and magnitude, allowing for the evaluation of these properties in alternans formation and suppression.",

      "Modulating the total amount of calcium released, we show that sufficiently increased calcium release may surprisingly prevent alternans via a mechanism linked to the functional depletion of junctional SR during release.",
      "We show that this mechanism underlies differences between \u201ceye-type\u201d and \u201cfork-type\u201d alternans, which were observed in human in vivo and in silico.",

      "Conclusion Both altered dynamics and magnitude of SR calcium release modulate alternans vulnerability.",
      "In particular, slow dynamics of SR release, such as those observed in heart failure, promote alternans.",
      "Therefore, acceleration of intracellular calcium release, e.g., via synchronization of calcium sparks, may inhibit alternans in failing hearts and reduce arrhythmia occurrence."

The IHM comprises several core cardiac models \u2013 electrophysiology, solid and fluid mechanics, microscopic cellular force generation, and valve dynamics \u2013 which are then coupled and finally embedded into the systemic and pulmonary blood circulations. It is a multiscale system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) featuring multiphysics interactions among the core models.<br/><br/>The physical and mathematical properties of each core model and those of the even more complex integrated heart model (IHM) will be analyzed. The numerical approximation of IHM develops along several steps: introduce new high order methods for the core models, carry out their stability and convergence analysis, devise new paradigms for their numerical coupling, and construct optimal, scalable, and adaptive preconditioners for the efficient solution of the resulting large-scale discrete problems. To address data variability in clinically relevant cases, new reduced order models and efficient computational techniques will be developed also for forward and inverse uncertainty quantification problems. Two software libraries, LifeHEART and RedHEART, will be built and made available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>The project is original, very ambitious, mathematically inspired and rigorous, tremendously challenging, and groundbreaking. If successful, it will provide researchers from applied mathematics and life sciences, cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons with a powerful tool for both the qualitative and quantitative study of cardiac function and dysfunction. iHEART has the potential to drive improvements in diagnosis and treatment for cardiovascular pathologies that are responsible for more than 45% of deaths in Europe.",

      "We hypothesize that the border zone is most vulnerable to alternans, that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation can suppresses this, and investigate the consequences in terms of arrhythmogenic mechanisms.",
      "Methods and Results: Anterior MI was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8) and allowed to heal over 2 months.",
      "This resulted in scar formation, significant (p < 0.05) dilation of the left ventricle, and reduction in ejection fraction compared to sham operated rats (n = 4) on 7 T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.",
      "Dual voltage/calcium optical mapping of post-MI Langendorff perfused hearts (using RH-237 and Rhod2) demonstrated that the border zone was significantly more prone to alternans than the surrounding myocardium at longer cycle lengths, predisposing to spatially heterogeneous alternans. \u03b2-Adrenergic receptor stimulation with norepinephrine (1 \u03bcmol/L) attenuated alternans by 60 [52\u201365]% [interquartile range] and this was reversed with metoprolol (10 \u03bcmol/L, p = 0.008).",
      "These results could be reproduced by computer modeling of the border zone based on our knowledge of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor signaling pathways and their influence on intracellular calcium handling and ion channels.",
      "Simulations also demonstrated that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation in this specific region reduced the formation of conduction block and the probability of premature ventricular activation propagation.",
      "Conclusion: While high levels of overall cardiac sympathetic drive are a negative prognostic indicator of mortality following MI and during heart failure, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation in the infarct border zone reduced spatially heterogeneous alternans, and prevented conduction block and propagation of extrasystoles.",
      "This may help explain recent clinical imaging studies using meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and 11C-meta-hydroxyephedrine positron emission tomography (PET) which demonstrate that border zone denervation is strongly associated with a high risk of future arrhythmia."

    "project_objective": "The recent IPCC report identifies mineral dust and the associated uncertainties in climate projections as key topics for future research. Dust size distribution in climate models controls the dust-radiation-cloud interactions and is a major contributor to these uncertainties. Observations show that the coarse mode of dust can be sustained during long-range transport, while current understanding fails in explaining why the lifetime of large airborne dust particles is longer than expected from gravitational settling theories. This discrepancy between observations and theory suggests that other processes counterbalance the effect of gravity along transport. D-TECT envisages filling this knowledge gap by studying the contribution of the triboelectrification (contact electrification) on particle removal processes. Our hypothesis is that triboelectric charging generates adequate electric fields to hold large dust particles up in the atmosphere. D-TECT aims to (i) parameterize the physical mechanisms responsible for dust triboelectrification; (ii) assess the impact of electrification on dust settling; (iii) quantify the climatic impacts of the process, particularly the effect on the dust size evolution during transport, on dry deposition and on CCN/IN reservoirs, and the effect of the electric field on particle orientation and on radiative transfer. The approach involves the development of a novel specialized high-power lidar system to detect and characterize aerosol particle orientation and a large-scale field experiment in the Mediterranean Basin using unprecedented ground-based remote sensing and airborne in-situ observation synergies. Considering aerosol-electricity interactions, the observations will be used to improve theoretical understanding and simulations of dust lifecycle. The project will provide new fundamental understanding, able to open new horizons for weather and climate science, including biogeochemistry, volcanic ash and extraterrestrial dust research.",

    "project_objective": "The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains makes tuberculosis (TB) a key priority for infectious disease research. Inflammation and autophagy are two fundamental processes critical to TB pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence shows that TB disease is worsened by deregulation of the inflammatory response. On the other hand, autophagy has recently emerged as a crucial host defence mechanism. Autophagy counteracts the ability of mycobacteria to survive inside host cells and targets them for degradation. Autophagy is also thought to control the inflammatory response. However, the interaction between inflammation and autophagy in host defence against TB remains unclear. The aim of my proposal is to use the well-established zebrafish model of TB to gain insight into this key question. Recently, the host laboratory discovered that the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM1) protects against TB in the zebrafish model. They also implicated this important autophagy regulator in inflammation, as it strongly affects expression of interleukin-1beta (IL1B). I have specific expertise in studying IL1B-mediated inflammation in zebrafish. Thus the proposed project will be a great synergy between me and the host laboratory, which is leading in zebrafish infectious disease research. I will determine how modulation of autophagy or manipulation of IL1B levels reciprocally influence each other during TB disease. The zebrafish model provides excellent tools to visualize these processes in vivo. Furthermore, I will take advantage of the host\u2019s expertise in RNA sequencing and proteomics to study genome-wide effects of autophagy modulation on the inflammatory response. A secondment will allow me to compare results in the TB model with a damage-induced inflammation model. The project will provide new insights into regulatory pathways that could potentially be intervened in treatment of TB or other inflammatory diseases with common characteristics.",

MHC proteins are essential for initiating every adaptive immune response and MHC is probably the most extreme example of how selection from a wide range of pathogens maintains high diversity in host immunity genes. However, the functions of the MHC proteins are only known in humans and model organisms, species that cannot be studied under natural conditions. There is therefore a need to study function of MHC proteins in species that can be thoroughly monitored in their natural habitat under varying pathogen regimes and over several generations. These parameters can be assessed in wild songbirds making them excellent study systems. Songbirds have large numbers of MHC gene copies, although little is known about how these affect their immune responses. Does high MHC copy number indicate that songbirds can recognize and combat more pathogens than other animals? They do fight infections satisfactory at their breeding, stopover and overwintering sites. <br/><br/>In this proposal my overarching aim is a more mechanistic understanding for survival and fitness linked to MHC in animals from wild populations and to take this field of research beyond the simple correlative associations that hitherto have been the rule. To reach this goal I must first characterize songbird MHC, now possible with \u2018single molecule real time sequencing\u2019. Therefore a rather substantial part of this proposal is technology. I will use two different songbird study systems; long-distance migratory great reed warblers and sedentary house sparrows and malaria-like pathogens infecting both these species. I am an experienced researcher on MHC and together with my team I will (1) characterize the MHC genomic region, (2) measure expression of MHC genes, (3) build MHC proteins and (4) measure functional MHC diversity in relation to fitness in wild birds, both in nature and in experimental set-ups.",

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

    "project_objective": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord affecting some 40,000 individuals in Europe, causing 11,000 deaths each year. Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS. We also integrate biomarkers for nerve cell damage into the trial design to provide proof of concept/mechanism. \u201cModifying Immune Response and OutComes in ALS\u201d (MIROCALS) will test the hypothesis that ld IL-2-induced increases in Tregs result in decreased rates of nerve cell damage and that this effect can be detected early in the course of the disease using a range of blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Our ambition is to develop a new therapy for ALS and through this novel trial design break the impasse in drug development of other disease-modifying agents in ALS. The impact will be to enhance quality of life and care for people with ALS, and provide a robust model for Industry to encourage investment in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

NAFLD is a spectrum of hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis); steatosis plus inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH); fibrosis/cirrhosis; and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high alcohol consumption. <br/>Up to 30% of the EU population have NAFLD, which will be the main aetiology underlying liver transplants by 2020. However, NAFLD is characterized by substantial inter-patient variability in severity and rate of progression. What determines this is unknown. A large population is at risk, but only some experience morbidity. NAFLD severity is currently best assessed by liver biopsy, an invasive, costly and risky procedure - factors that hinder treatment. There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease.

However, these techniques have had difficulty working with biosensors, largely limiting the information to the spatial location of the labels. <br/>This project seeks to develop diffraction-unlimited imaging of biosensors, creating activity maps with a diffraction-unlimited spatial resolution in living systems.

The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present, AAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on effectiveness in small animal models. We (and others) have shown substantial progress in improving gene therapy for eye diseases in rodents. However, small animal studies are not often predictive of human outcome when it comes to the efficacy of viral delivery. Moreover, non-human primates used as pre-clinical animal models do not display any pathology making them unsuitable for testing efficacy. Here, I propose to overcome these bottlenecks in translational gene therapy by generating non-human primate models of retinal degeneration where effects of therapies and prosthesis on sight restoration can be tested. Generating transgenic primates using germline transgenesis would be very costly and ethically problematic. I thus propose to induce retinal disease locally, following delivery of pathogenic genes within specific subsets of cells in the non-human primate retina (Aim A). In Aim B, I propose to develop novel AAVs for use in human gene therapy using directed evolution. This bioengineering approach has yielded AAVs with enhanced delivery properties in the murine retina and applying it to post-mortem human retinas will generate AAVs responding to a clinical need in gene therapy. All together, the creation of models of disease in primates combined with novel AAVs tested in human post-mortem retinas will enable us to validate therapies aiming at vision restoration and neuroprotection in retinas with a macula and high central visual acuity, removing a major roadblock in the development of ocular therapeutics for humans.",

    "project_objective": "Alcohol overuse is an important societal challenge with annual healthcare costs of over \u20ac22 billion in Europe. Alcohol is the main cause of liver cirrhosis, which is the 5th and 7th most common cause of life years lost in respectively Eastern and Western Europe. Cirrhosis is considered irreversible but its precursor, liver fibrosis, is reversible when detected before disease progression. GALAXY proposes that crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the liver influences the development and progression of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Here, a \u2018dysbiotic\u2019 microbiome in susceptible individuals leads to progressive liver fibrosis in combination with alcohol overuse. Therefore, interventions aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiome will reduce disease development. We will use state-of-the-art systems medicine tools to improve understanding of the complex interplay present during alcoholic liver fibrosis, to identify at-risk individuals in time and to develop personalised healthcare strategies for alcohol over-users (20% of the EU population >15 years old). GALAXY brings together partners with unique research competences in clinical hepatology, microbiome, multi-omics, biomarkers and bioinformatics. Our aim is to develop novel systems medicine tools which integrate clinical, multi-omics and lifestyle information from alcohol over-users at various stages of the disease and healthy individuals in order to: 1) identify signatures of host-microbial cross-talk during disease development and progression, 2) translate this into biomarkers for diagnosis, stratification and treatment monitoring in alcohol over users, and 3) evaluate new interventions to modulate gut microbiota towards prevention and mitigation of the disease in at-risk individuals. We will also study societal and economic impact of GALAXY biomarkers and treatments to accelerate future development. The GALAXY consortium includes strong SME partners who will enable the results to be exploited commercially.",

      "Methods: Blood sampling from peripheral and central vascular beds was performed intra-operatively for cirrhotic patients at the time of liver transplantation (LT) or trans-jugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures to measure angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1\u20137) peptide levels and ACE and ACE2 enzyme activity.",
      "Relevant clinical and hemodynamic data were recorded pre-operatively for all subjects and peripheral blood sampling was repeated 3 months or later post-operatively.",
      "Results: Ang-(1\u2013-7) and ACE2 activity were up-regulated more than twofold in cirrhotic subjects both at the time of LT and TIPS and levels returned to comparable levels as control subjects post-transplantation.",
      "Ang-(1\u20137) levels correlated positively with the degree of liver disease severity, as measured by the model for an end-stage liver disease (MELD) and also with clinical parameters of pathological vasodilatation including cardiac output (CO).",
      "There were strong correlations found between the ACE2:ACE and the Ang-(1\u20137):Ang II ratio highlighting the inter-dependence of the alternate and classical arms of the RAS and thus their potential impact on vascular tone.",
      "Conclusions: In human cirrhosis, the alternate RAS is markedly upregulated and the activation of this system is associated strongly with features of the hyperdynamic circulation in advanced human cirrhosis."

There is a need to understand the biological and environmental factors that drive inter-patient variability and to develop robust and more acceptable methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy so that effective medical care may be targeted to those that will benefit most. <br/>The overall EPoS concept is that improved understanding of pathogenic processes and drivers of disease progression will best be achieved when multiple \u2018omics\u2019 approaches are applied to a single cohort of patients to build a multi-dimensional record of how systems are perturbed across the entire spectrum of disease. NAFLD sits at the intersection of key biological processes: carbohydrate/lipid homeostasis, immune/inflammatory activation, wound healing/fibrosis and cancer biology. Once completed, EPoS promises to deliver a substantial and definitive atlas of pathophysiological variation across a spectrum of progressive liver disease. Translation of these findings will therefore impact on closely related pathologies including T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

These patients require life-long medications that subsequently trigger metabolic diseases with a strong negative impact on their health and well-being. To achieve this, and improve adherence to treatments, we will evaluate how short-term antipsychotic drug responses impact long-term metabolic control to identify and validate biomarkers with clinically predictive value for targeting drug induced metabolic dysfunctions. This effort will have added commercial value by enabling the design of predictive marker kits for testing adverse secondary metabolic effects of drugs to be used in pharmacological and medical practice. TREATMENT will provide multidisciplinary knowledge, capabilities and tools to implement this ambitious strategy by the training of young scientists in a program that combines pharmacology, metabolism and mental health research with strategies for product and tool design and validation. Our ultimate goal is to empower the intersectorial and trans-national employability of young scientists across academic, public and private sectors to foster the development and implementation of personalized medicine tools that will provide effective treatment regimens for life long health-care interventions and decrease the risk for development of chronic metabolic diseases.",

The project will pursue a consolidated methodology for integrating the monitoring system components, as well as innovation for estimating fossil fuel CO2 fluxes. These include reconciling bottom-up and top-down constraints and handling systematic errors of satellite sensors. Earth observations from satellites will be combined with in situ CO2 observations and information from co-emitters or isotopes to support the attribution of fossil fuel emissions and uncertainty reduction. Methodological advances will include a representation of anthropogenic CO2 variability in space and time, responding to documented shortcomings and needs, and a carbon cycle data assimilation system extended to enable estimates of emission uncertainties. Strategies to separate anthropogenic CO2 emissions from biogenic fluxes at country to global scales using observations and models will be documented. CHE will support a large community by providing a library of realistic CO2 simulations from global to city scale to examine the capacity for monitoring future fossil fuel emissions and to adequately dimension space mission requirements. Community building will include direct collaboration across 22 European institutions, and communication and liaison with key European and international stakeholders.

We will elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these gigantic molecules and  devise a set of rules similar to the magic numbers found in gold nanoclusters, using these to break the 10 nm size barrier for a single molecule. Targeted properties include photochemical and electrochemical sensors, bistable molecules, doped traditional oxides with polyoxometalates, and new catalysts including water oxidation via a Universal Building Block (UBB) approach that links properties of the building blocks with emergent properties of the resulting clusters and materials for the first time. The new approach includes the conversion of batch to flow synthesis not only for automation, but to understand fundamental mechanistic aspects, and to use artificial intelligence algorithms to help move through the myriad of possible combinations (without needing to synthesise every possible molecule).  The SMART-POM approach is therefore not merely automation of one-pot chemistry, but an entirely new paradigm building on our recent developments and will allow us to move through a vast combinatorial space effectively only locating areas of novelty via feedback control. This feedback will be used to discover, design, and develop complex, adaptive and functional metal oxide-based materials based upon sensory feedback from the physical properties measurements. Thus SMART-POM will open up a whole new synthetic space, give mechanistic understanding, and allow the discovery of molecules with potential real-world applications. Finally, we will aim to extend the SMART-POM paradigm to other areas of chemistry which will benefit from the search for novelty.",

    "project_objective": "Regenerating tissues by reprogramming cells has the potential to become a therapeutic approach for replacing lost tissues in patients suffering from injury or degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Muscular Dystrophy. Strategies to generate required tissues using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are associated with either ethical or medical safety issues. An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates. Our research has the potential to facilitate the generation of specific tissues from different cellular contexts for future biomedical approaches.",

The IHM comprises several core cardiac models \u2013 electrophysiology, solid and fluid mechanics, microscopic cellular force generation, and valve dynamics \u2013 which are then coupled and finally embedded into the systemic and pulmonary blood circulations. It is a multiscale system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) featuring multiphysics interactions among the core models.<br/><br/>The physical and mathematical properties of each core model and those of the even more complex integrated heart model (IHM) will be analyzed. The numerical approximation of IHM develops along several steps: introduce new high order methods for the core models, carry out their stability and convergence analysis, devise new paradigms for their numerical coupling, and construct optimal, scalable, and adaptive preconditioners for the efficient solution of the resulting large-scale discrete problems. To address data variability in clinically relevant cases, new reduced order models and efficient computational techniques will be developed also for forward and inverse uncertainty quantification problems. Two software libraries, LifeHEART and RedHEART, will be built and made available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>The project is original, very ambitious, mathematically inspired and rigorous, tremendously challenging, and groundbreaking. If successful, it will provide researchers from applied mathematics and life sciences, cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons with a powerful tool for both the qualitative and quantitative study of cardiac function and dysfunction. iHEART has the potential to drive improvements in diagnosis and treatment for cardiovascular pathologies that are responsible for more than 45% of deaths in Europe.",

      "In geoengineering studies, these injections are commonly targeted to the Equator, where the yearly mean intensity of the solar radiation is the highest and from where the aerosols disperse globally due to the Brewer\u2013Dobson Circulation.",
      "However, compensating for greenhouse gas-induced zonal warming by reducing solar radiation would require a relatively larger radiative forcing to the mid- and high latitudes and a lower forcing to the low latitudes than what is achieved by continuous equatorial injections.",
      "In this study we employ alternative aerosol injection scenarios to investigate if the resulting radiative forcing can be targeted to be zonally more uniform without decreasing the global the mean radiative forcing of stratospheric sulfur geoengineering.",
      "We used a global aerosol\u2013climate model together with an Earth system model to study the radiative and climate effects of stratospheric sulfur injection scenarios with different injection areas.",
      "According to our simulations, varying the SO2 injection area seasonally would result in a similar global mean cooling effect as injecting SO2 to the Equator, but with a more uniform zonal distribution of shortwave radiative forcing.",
      "Compared to the case of equatorial injections, in the seasonally varying injection scenario where the maximum sulfur production from injected SO2 followed the maximum of solar radiation, the shortwave radiative forcing decreased by 27\u202f% over the Equator (the latitudes between 20\u00b0\u202fN and 20\u00b0\u202fS) and increased by 15\u202f% over higher latitudes.",
      "Compared to the continuous injections to the Equator, in summer months the radiative forcing was increased by 17 and 14\u202f% and in winter months decreased by 14 and 16\u202f% in Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively.",
      "However, these forcings do not translate into as large changes in temperatures.",
      "The changes in forcing would only lead to 0.05\u202fK warmer winters and 0.05\u202fK cooler summers in the Northern Hemisphere, which is roughly 3\u202f% of the cooling resulting from solar radiation management scenarios studied here."

    "project_objective": "The recent IPCC report identifies mineral dust and the associated uncertainties in climate projections as key topics for future research. Dust size distribution in climate models controls the dust-radiation-cloud interactions and is a major contributor to these uncertainties. Observations show that the coarse mode of dust can be sustained during long-range transport, while current understanding fails in explaining why the lifetime of large airborne dust particles is longer than expected from gravitational settling theories. This discrepancy between observations and theory suggests that other processes counterbalance the effect of gravity along transport. D-TECT envisages filling this knowledge gap by studying the contribution of the triboelectrification (contact electrification) on particle removal processes. Our hypothesis is that triboelectric charging generates adequate electric fields to hold large dust particles up in the atmosphere. D-TECT aims to (i) parameterize the physical mechanisms responsible for dust triboelectrification; (ii) assess the impact of electrification on dust settling; (iii) quantify the climatic impacts of the process, particularly the effect on the dust size evolution during transport, on dry deposition and on CCN/IN reservoirs, and the effect of the electric field on particle orientation and on radiative transfer. The approach involves the development of a novel specialized high-power lidar system to detect and characterize aerosol particle orientation and a large-scale field experiment in the Mediterranean Basin using unprecedented ground-based remote sensing and airborne in-situ observation synergies. Considering aerosol-electricity interactions, the observations will be used to improve theoretical understanding and simulations of dust lifecycle. The project will provide new fundamental understanding, able to open new horizons for weather and climate science, including biogeochemistry, volcanic ash and extraterrestrial dust research.",

Human emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) have however led to dramatic stratospheric ozone losses for decades. This global problem is ongoing and of renewed concern due to recent unexpected changes. It is also likely affecting the nature of the stratosphere itself, with implications for global health and economy. In addition, emissions of greenhouse gases have been proposed to lead to a long-term acceleration of the stratospheric overturning circulation. In summary, significant stratospheric changes are to be expected from both, ozone losses and global warming.<br/>Indications for such changes have been reported, but there are substantial uncertainties and limitations connected with these studies. In addition, current technologies to explore stratospheric composition and chemistry are very expensive and often offer only infrequent data. There is clearly a need for new and improved tools to correctly detect and quantify changes from observations.<br/>This project will open 3 novel avenues to explore stratospheric chemistry, composition and circulation:<br/>1) A newly developed low-cost technology to retrieve and analyse air from the stratosphere. This will be a new way to derive budgets of all important and newly emerging ODSs directly in the stratosphere; while at the same time providing observations of many strong greenhouse gases.<br/>2) I have found new evidence for substantial past changes in stratospheric chemistry and circulation. An unprecedented investigation of stratospheric air archives spanning 40 years and >50 trace gases will allow new insights into these changes <br/>3) New diagnosis tools and a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art models will identify the implications for future climate.<br/>The EXC3ITE project will result in a breakthrough in the understanding of stratospheric changes which are of high importance for society through their impact on climate prediction and ozone recovery.",

      "Atmospheric measurements of the ozone-depleting substance CFC-113a (CCl3CF3) are reported from ground-based stations in Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia and the United Kingdom, together with aircraft-based data for the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.",
      "Building on previous work, we find that, since the gas first appeared in the atmosphere in the 1960s, global CFC-113a mixing ratios have been increasing monotonically to the present day.",
      "Mixing ratios of CFC-113a have increased by 40\u202f% from 0.50 to 0.70\u202fppt in the Southern Hemisphere between the end of the previously published record in December 2012 and February 2017.",
      "We derive updated global emissions of 1.7\u202fGg\u202fyr\u22121 on average between 2012 and 2016 using a two-dimensional model.",
      "We compare the long-term trends and emissions of CFC-113a to those of its structural isomer, CFC-113 (CClF2CCl2F), which still has much higher mixing ratios than CFC-113a, despite its mixing ratios and emissions decreasing since the 1990s.",
      "The continued presence of northern hemispheric emissions of CFC-113a is confirmed by our measurements of a persistent interhemispheric gradient in its mixing ratios, with higher mixing ratios in the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "The sources of CFC-113a are still unclear, but we present evidence that indicates large emissions in East Asia, most likely due to its use as a chemical involved in the production of hydrofluorocarbons.",
      "Our aircraft data confirm the interhemispheric gradient as well as showing mixing ratios consistent with ground-based observations and the relatively long atmospheric lifetime of CFC-113a.",
      "CFC-113a is the only known CFC for which abundances are still increasing substantially in the atmosphere."

    "project_objective": "The goal of PRIMAVERA is to deliver novel, advanced and well-evaluated high-resolution global climate models (GCMs), capable of simulating and predicting regional climate with unprecedented fidelity, out to 2050. This capability will deliver innovative climate science and a new generation of advanced Earth System Models. Sector-specific end-users in policy and business will be identified and engaged individually, with iterative feedback, to ensure that new climate information is tailored, actionable and strengthening societal risk management decisions.<br/>These goals will be achieved through the development of coupled GCMs from seven groups across Europe, with sufficient resolution to reproduce realistic weather and climate features (~25km mesh size), in addition to enhanced process parameterisation. Thorough assessment will use innovative process-based metrics and the latest observational and reanalysis datasets. Targeted experimental design will reduce inter-model spread and produce robust projections, forming the European contribution to the CMIP6 High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, led by PRIMAVERA. <br/>It is the first time that high-resolution coupled GCMs will be used under a single experimental protocol. Coordination, and the underlying process-understanding, will significantly increase the robustness of our findings. Our new capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the drivers of variability and change in European climate, including extremes, since such regional changes continue to be characterised by high uncertainty. <br/>We will also explore the frontiers of climate modelling and of high performance computing to produce simulations with a reduced reliance on physical parameterisations. These will explicitly resolve key processes such as ocean eddies, and will include new stochastic parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes. These \u201cfrontiers\u201d simulations will further our understanding of the robustness of climate projections.",

      "The LWP adjusts to allow the rain rate to be equal to the moisture flux into the cyclone along the WCB.",

    "project_objective": "The recent IPCC report identifies mineral dust and the associated uncertainties in climate projections as key topics for future research. Dust size distribution in climate models controls the dust-radiation-cloud interactions and is a major contributor to these uncertainties. Observations show that the coarse mode of dust can be sustained during long-range transport, while current understanding fails in explaining why the lifetime of large airborne dust particles is longer than expected from gravitational settling theories. This discrepancy between observations and theory suggests that other processes counterbalance the effect of gravity along transport. D-TECT envisages filling this knowledge gap by studying the contribution of the triboelectrification (contact electrification) on particle removal processes. Our hypothesis is that triboelectric charging generates adequate electric fields to hold large dust particles up in the atmosphere. D-TECT aims to (i) parameterize the physical mechanisms responsible for dust triboelectrification; (ii) assess the impact of electrification on dust settling; (iii) quantify the climatic impacts of the process, particularly the effect on the dust size evolution during transport, on dry deposition and on CCN/IN reservoirs, and the effect of the electric field on particle orientation and on radiative transfer. The approach involves the development of a novel specialized high-power lidar system to detect and characterize aerosol particle orientation and a large-scale field experiment in the Mediterranean Basin using unprecedented ground-based remote sensing and airborne in-situ observation synergies. Considering aerosol-electricity interactions, the observations will be used to improve theoretical understanding and simulations of dust lifecycle. The project will provide new fundamental understanding, able to open new horizons for weather and climate science, including biogeochemistry, volcanic ash and extraterrestrial dust research.",

This capability will deliver innovative climate science and a new generation of advanced Earth System Models. Sector-specific end-users in policy and business will be identified and engaged individually, with iterative feedback, to ensure that new climate information is tailored, actionable and strengthening societal risk management decisions.<br/>These goals will be achieved through the development of coupled GCMs from seven groups across Europe, with sufficient resolution to reproduce realistic weather and climate features (~25km mesh size), in addition to enhanced process parameterisation. Thorough assessment will use innovative process-based metrics and the latest observational and reanalysis datasets. Targeted experimental design will reduce inter-model spread and produce robust projections, forming the European contribution to the CMIP6 High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, led by PRIMAVERA. <br/>It is the first time that high-resolution coupled GCMs will be used under a single experimental protocol. Coordination, and the underlying process-understanding, will significantly increase the robustness of our findings. Our new capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the drivers of variability and change in European climate, including extremes, since such regional changes continue to be characterised by high uncertainty. <br/>We will also explore the frontiers of climate modelling and of high performance computing to produce simulations with a reduced reliance on physical parameterisations. These will explicitly resolve key processes such as ocean eddies, and will include new stochastic parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes. These \u201cfrontiers\u201d simulations will further our understanding of the robustness of climate projections.",

We will resolve this scale problem by using statistical emulation to build computationally fast surrogate models (i.e. emulators) that can reproduce the effective output of a detailed high-resolution cloud-resolving model. By incorporating these emulators into a state-of-the-science climate model, we will for the first time achieve the accuracy of a limited-area high-resolution model on a global scale with negligible computational cost.<br/><br/>The main scientific outcome of the project will be a highly refined and physically sound estimate of the aerosol indirect effect that enables more accurate projections of future climate change, and thus has high societal relevance. In addition, the developed emulators will help to quantify how the remaining uncertainties in aerosol properties propagate to predictions of aerosol indirect effect. This information will be used, together with an extensive set of remote sensing, in-situ and laboratory data from our collaborators, to improve the process-level understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions. <br/><br/>The comprehensive uncertainty analyses performed during this project will be highly valuable for future research efforts as they point to processes and interactions that most urgently need to be experimentally constrained.

We will experimentally determine the contribution of induced BVOC emissions from insect herbivory in the warming Arctic by field manipulation experiments addressing basal herbivory and insect outbreaks and by stable isotope labelling to identify sources of the induced emission. Complementary laboratory assessment will determine if permafrost thaw leads to significant BVOC emissions from thawing processes and newly available soil processes, or if released BVOCs are largely taken up by soil microbes. We will also use a global network of existing climate warming experiments in alpine tundra to assess how the BVOC emissions from tundra vegetation world-wide respond to climate change.<br/>Measurement data will help develop and parameterize BVOC emission models to produce holistic enhanced predictions for global tundra emissions.

Accurate characterization of the space-time variations of GHG fluxes, separating their anthropogenic and natural components and their drivers, will be based on advanced modelling approaches using atmospheric GHG measurements, tracer transport inversions and various arrays of land observations, in-situ and from space. The improved knowledge of GHG budgets from VERIFY will be used to improve national inventories, in collaboration with national inventory agencies, and to deliver policy-relevant information to track progress of the EU mitigation efforts to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement on Climate, in line with international cooperation mechanisms promoted by the WMO, the IPCC and the UNFCCC.",

      "Abstract.",
      "FLUXNET comprises globally distributed eddy-covariance-based estimates of carbon fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere.",
      "Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere\u2013atmosphere exchange.",
      "Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were employed.",
      "Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles (R2>0.94 at 1\u2218 spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70\u2009% of the land surface, values outside the FLUXCOM range.",
      "Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008\u20132010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130\u2009PgC\u2009yr\u22121 with the largest uncertainty in the tropics.",
      "Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise R2\u223c0.75) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise R2\u223c0.6).",
      "Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions (R2>0.92).",
      "Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs.",
      "The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (R2=0.87 for 2001\u20132010).",
      "Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year.",
      "These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies.",
      "We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM.",
      "Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for CO2 fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic.",
      "Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation.",
      "Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall."

This will cement EU science as the world-leader in understanding climate sensitivity and climate variability, deliver significantly improved capability to make climate projections for the next 20-50 years, and provide up-to-date scientific evidence for international climate policy in two phases: Phase 1 will deliver a timely characterisation of physical science uncertainty and how it affects projections and committed levels of warming to the 2021 IPCC sixth assessment report; Phase 2 will deliver constrained surface temperature projections for the 2023 UNFCCC Global Stocktake. CONSTRAIN will take full advantage of climate model integrations from the sixth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and will leverage existing H2020 and ERC projects. Novel CMIP6 analyses will be combined with dedicated high resolution simulations and new observations to address identified knowledge gaps on radiative forcing, cloud feedbacks and the relationship between ocean variability and atmospheric change. A fourth identified knowledge gap is the effective translation of new physical science understanding into an improved evidence base for policy decisions. CONSTRAIN will address this by developing climate model emulators that integrate and operationalise learning from across the consortium to provide new capability to assess impacts of climate change under a broad range of emission scenarios. We will focus on the expected spatially resolved decadal changes until mid-century providing robust evidence on climate sensitivity, and regional temperature, precipitation and circulation changes, thereby enabling evidence-based policy decisions that will directly benefit the EU's adaptation and mitigation strategy.",

Understanding such variations requires insights from the past. However, no data sets of past climate are available to study decadal variability of large-scale climate with state-of-the-art diagnostic methods. Currently available data sets are limited to statistical reconstructions of local or regional surface climate. The PALAEO-RA project will produce the first ever comprehensive, 3-dimensional, physically consistent reconstruction of the global climate system at a monthly scale for the past six centuries. This palaeoreanalysis is based on combining information from early instrumental measurements, historical documents (e.g. capitalizing on large amounts of newly available data from China), and proxies (e.g. tree rings) with a large ensemble of climate model simulations. To achieve this novel combination, a completely new data assimilation system for palaeoclimatological data will be developed. The unique data sets produced in this project will become reference data sets for studying past climatic variations (i) for diagnostic studies of interannual-to-decadal variability, (ii) as a benchmark for model simulations and (iii) for climate impact studies. Using the data produced, the project will analyse episodes of slowed or accelerated global warming, decadal subtropical drought periods, episodes of expanding or contracting tropics, slowed or strengthened monsoons, changes in storm tracks, blocking and associated weather extremes, and links between Arctic and midlatitude climate. The analyses will provide new insights into the processes governing decadal variability of weather and climate.",

To meet this objective, 4C will (a) provide a step change in our ability to quantify the key processes regulating the coupled carbon-climate system, (b) use observational constraints and improved processes understanding to provide multi-model near-term predictions and long-term projections of the climate in response to anthropogenic emissions, and (c) deliver policy-relevant carbon dioxide emission pathways consistent with the UNFCCC Paris Agreement (PA) goals.  <br/>To achieve its goals, 4C will develop and use: state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) including biogeochemical processes not included in previous IPCC reports; novel observations to constrain the contemporary carbon cycle and its natural variability; ESM-based decadal predictions including carbon-climate feedbacks and novel initialisation methods; novel emergent constraints and weighting methods to reduce uncertainty in carbon cycle and climate projections; and novel climate scenarios following adaptive CO2 emission pathways. <br/>4C will support two central elements of the PA.

Measuring the effectiveness of GHG emission reduction policies against agreed-upon international targets require accurate and precise estimates of emissions and their trends. These estimates need to be established and regularly updated using transparent methods, tracable to international standards. VERIFY proposes to quantify more accurately carbon stocks and the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) across the EU based on independent observations in support of inventories that rely only on statistical data.  The same approach will also be tested for US, China and Indonesia, in collaboration with foreign partnes. Accurate characterization of the space-time variations of GHG fluxes, separating their anthropogenic and natural components and their drivers, will be based on advanced modelling approaches using atmospheric GHG measurements, tracer transport inversions and various arrays of land observations, in-situ and from space. The improved knowledge of GHG budgets from VERIFY will be used to improve national inventories, in collaboration with national inventory agencies, and to deliver policy-relevant information to track progress of the EU mitigation efforts to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement on Climate, in line with international cooperation mechanisms promoted by the WMO, the IPCC and the UNFCCC.",

      "Abstract.",
      "Understanding and quantifying the global methane (CH4) budget is important for assessing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change.",
      "Atmospheric emissions and concentrations of CH4 continue to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon dioxide (CO2).",
      "The relative importance of CH4 compared to CO2 depends on its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger warming potential, and variations in atmospheric growth rate over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated.",
      "Two major challenges in reducing uncertainties in the atmospheric growth rate arise from the variety of geographically overlapping CH4 sources and from the destruction of CH4 by short-lived hydroxyl radicals (OH).",
      "To address these challenges, we have established a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate new research aimed at improving and regularly updating the global methane budget.",
      "Following Saunois et al.\u00a0(2016), we present here the second version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal methane budget, integrating results of top-down studies (atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up estimates (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations).",
      "For the 2008\u20132017 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (a top-down approach) to be 576\u2009Tg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121 (range 550\u2013594, corresponding to the minimum and maximum estimates of the model ensemble).",
      "Of this total, 359\u2009Tg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121 or \u223c\u200960\u2009% is attributed to anthropogenic sources, that is emissions caused by direct human activity (i.e. anthropogenic emissions; range 336\u2013376\u2009Tg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121 or 50\u2009%\u201365\u2009%).",
      "The mean annual total emission for the new decade (2008\u20132017) is 29\u2009Tg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121 larger than our estimate for the previous decade (2000\u20132009), and 24\u2009Tg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121 larger than the one reported in the previous budget for 2003\u20132012 (Saunois et al., 2016).",
      "Since 2012, global CH4 emissions have been tracking the warmest scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",
      "Bottom-up methods suggest almost 30\u2009% larger global emissions (737\u2009Tg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121, range 594\u2013881) than top-down inversion methods.",
      "Indeed, bottom-up estimates for natural sources such as natural wetlands, other inland water systems, and geological sources are higher than top-down estimates.",
      "The atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget suggest that at least some of these bottom-up emissions are overestimated.",
      "The latitudinal distribution of atmospheric observation-based emissions indicates a predominance of tropical emissions (\u223c\u200965\u2009% of the global budget, <\u200930\u2218\u2009N) compared to mid-latitudes (\u223c\u200930\u2009%, 30\u201360\u2218\u2009N) and high northern latitudes (\u223c\u20094\u2009%, 60\u201390\u2218\u2009N).",
      "The most important source of uncertainty in the methane budget is attributable to natural emissions, especially those from wetlands and other inland waters.",
      "Some of our global source estimates are smaller than those in previously published budgets (Saunois et al., 2016; Kirschke et al., 2013).",
      "In particular wetland emissions are about 35\u2009Tg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121 lower due to improved partition wetlands and other inland waters.",
      "Emissions from geological sources and wild animals are also found to be smaller by 7\u2009Tg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121 by 8\u2009Tg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121, respectively.",
      "However, the overall discrepancy between bottom-up and top-down estimates has been reduced by only 5\u2009% compared to Saunois et al.\u00a0(2016), due to a higher estimate of emissions from inland waters, highlighting the need for more detailed research on emissions factors.",
      "Priorities for improving the methane budget include (i)\u00a0a global, high-resolution map of water-saturated soils and inundated areas emitting methane based on a robust classification of different types of emitting habitats; (ii)\u00a0further development of process-based models for inland-water emissions; (iii)\u00a0intensification of methane observations at local scales (e.g., FLUXNET-CH4 measurements) and urban-scale monitoring to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scales (surface networks and satellites) to constrain atmospheric inversions; (iv)\u00a0improvements of transport models and the representation of photochemical sinks in top-down inversions; and (v)\u00a0development of a 3D variational inversion system using isotopic and/or co-emitted species such as ethane to improve source partitioning.",

      "Additionally, sensitivity tests related to the parameterization of snow albedo were conducted.",
      "Our results show that overall the new model version improves the representation of the Fenno-Scandinavian climate in terms of 2\u202fm temperature and precipitation, but the downside is that an existing wintertime cold bias in the model is enhanced.",
      "The lake surface water temperature, ice depth and ice season length were analyzed in detail for 10 Finnish, 4 Swedish and 2 Russian lakes and 1 Estonian lake.",
      "The results show that the model can reproduce these characteristics with reasonably high accuracy.",
      "The cold bias during winter causes overestimation of ice layer thickness, for example, at several of the studied lakes, but overall the values from the model are realistic and represent the lake physics well in a\u00a0long-term simulation.",
      "We also analyzed the snow depth on ice from 10 Finnish lakes and vertical temperature profiles from 5 Finnish lakes and the model results are realistic."

    "project_objective": "The Land Biosphere is a critical component of the Earth System, linking to climate through multiple feedback processes. Understanding these feedback processes is a huge intellectual challenge. In part because of the pioneering work of the PI (Cox et al., 2000), many of the climate projections reported in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) now include climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. However the latest Earth System Models (ESMs) continue to show a huge range in the projected responses of the land carbon cycle over the 21st century. This uncertainty threatens to undermine the value of these projections to inform climate policy.  This project (ECCLES) is designed to produce significant reductions in the uncertainties associated with land-climate interactions, using the novel concept of Emergent Constraints - relationships between future projections and observable variations in the current Earth System that are common across the ensemble of ESMs. Emergent Constraints have many attractive features but chief amongst these is that they can make ensembles of ESMs more than the sum of the parts - allowing the full range of ESM projections to be used collectively, alongside key observations, to reduce uncertainties in the future climate. The project will deliver: (i) a theoretical foundation for Emergent Constraints; (ii) new datasets on the changing function of the land biosphere; (iii) Emergent Constraints on land-climate interactions based on observed temporal and spatial variations; (iv) a new generation of scientists expert in land-climate interactions and Emergent Constraints. ECCLES will benefit from the expertise and experience of the PI, which includes training as a theoretical physicist, an early career developing models of the land biosphere for ESMs, and a current career in a department of mathematics where he is at the forefront of efforts to develop and apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (Cox et al., 2013, Wenzel et al., 2016).",

      "Abstract.",
      "In August 2017 Bangladesh faced one of its worst river flooding events in recent history.",
      "This paper presents, for the first time, an attribution of this precipitation-induced flooding to anthropogenic climate change from a combined meteorological and hydrological perspective.",
      "Experiments were conducted with three observational datasets and two climate models to estimate changes in the extreme 10-day precipitation event frequency over the Brahmaputra basin up to the present and, additionally, an outlook to 2\u2009\u2218C warming since pre-industrial times.",
      "The precipitation fields were then used as meteorological input for four different hydrological models to estimate the corresponding changes in river discharge, allowing for comparison between approaches and for the robustness of the attribution results to be assessed.",
      "In all three observational precipitation datasets the climate change trends for extreme precipitation similar to that observed in August 2017 are not significant, however in two out of three series, the sign of this insignificant trend is positive.",
      "One climate model ensemble shows a significant positive influence of anthropogenic climate change, whereas the other large ensemble model simulates a cancellation between the increase due to greenhouse gases (GHGs) and a decrease due to sulfate aerosols.",
      "Considering discharge rather than precipitation, the hydrological models show that attribution of the change in discharge towards higher values is somewhat less uncertain than in precipitation, but the 95\u2009% confidence intervals still encompass no change in risk.",
      "Extending the analysis to the future, all models project an increase in probability of extreme events at 2\u2009\u2218C global heating since pre-industrial times, becoming more than 1.7\u00a0times more likely for high 10-day precipitation and being more likely by a factor of about 1.5 for discharge.",
      "Our best estimate on the trend in flooding events similar to the Brahmaputra event of August\u00a02017 is derived by synthesizing the observational and model results: we find the change in risk to be greater than 1 and of a similar order of magnitude (between\u00a01 and 2) for both the meteorological and hydrological approach.",
      "This study shows that, for precipitation-induced flooding events, investigating changes in precipitation is useful, either as an alternative when hydrological models are not available or as an additional measure to confirm qualitative conclusions.",
      "Besides this, it highlights the importance of using multiple models in attribution studies, particularly where the climate change signal is not strong relative to natural variability or is confounded by other factors such as aerosols."

This challenging target is aligned with the European Commission\u2019s stepwise approach for a requirement-driven integration of Earth observations, from remote sensing and in situ, with enhanced modelling capabilities for CO2 fossil fuel emissions, along with other natural and anthropogenic CO2 emissions and transport. The project will pursue a consolidated methodology for integrating the monitoring system components, as well as innovation for estimating fossil fuel CO2 fluxes. These include reconciling bottom-up and top-down constraints and handling systematic errors of satellite sensors. Earth observations from satellites will be combined with in situ CO2 observations and information from co-emitters or isotopes to support the attribution of fossil fuel emissions and uncertainty reduction. Methodological advances will include a representation of anthropogenic CO2 variability in space and time, responding to documented shortcomings and needs, and a carbon cycle data assimilation system extended to enable estimates of emission uncertainties. Strategies to separate anthropogenic CO2 emissions from biogenic fluxes at country to global scales using observations and models will be documented. CHE will support a large community by providing a library of realistic CO2 simulations from global to city scale to examine the capacity for monitoring future fossil fuel emissions and to adequately dimension space mission requirements. Community building will include direct collaboration across 22 European institutions, and communication and liaison with key European and international stakeholders. These coordination efforts will ensure the transfer of science and technology requirements and recommendations for strengthening existing assets with a view to developing an anthropogenic CO2 monitoring service.",

      "The estimate of the current and future conditions of snow resources in mountain areas would require reliable, kilometre-resolution, regional-observation-based gridded data sets and climate models capable of properly representing snow processes and snow\u2013climate interactions.",
      "At the moment, the development of such tools is hampered by the sparseness of station-based reference observations.",
      "In past decades passive microwave remote sensing and reanalysis products have mainly been used to infer information on the snow water equivalent distribution.",
      "However, the investigation has usually been limited to flat terrains as the reliability of these products in mountain areas is poorly characterized.This work considers the available snow water equivalent data sets from remote sensing and from reanalyses for the greater Alpine region (GAR), and explores their ability to provide a coherent view of the snow water equivalent distribution and climatology in this area.",
      "Further we analyse the simulations from the latest-generation regional and global climate models (RCMs, GCMs), participating in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment over the European domain (EURO-CORDEX) and in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) respectively.",
      "We evaluate their reliability in reproducing the main drivers of snow processes \u2013 near-surface air temperature and precipitation \u2013 against the observational data set EOBS, and compare the snow water equivalent climatology with the remote sensing and reanalysis data sets previously considered.",
      "We critically discuss the model limitations in the historical period and we explore their potential in providing reliable future projections.The results of the analysis show that the time-averaged spatial distribution of snow water equivalent and the amplitude of its annual cycle are reproduced quite differently by the different remote sensing and reanalysis data sets, which in fact exhibit a large spread around the ensemble mean.",
      "We find that GCMs at spatial resolutions equal to or finer than 1.25\u00b0 longitude are in closer agreement with the ensemble mean of satellite and reanalysis products in terms of root mean square error and standard deviation than lower-resolution GCMs.",
      "The set of regional climate models from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble provides estimates of snow water equivalent at 0.11\u00b0 resolution that are locally much larger than those indicated by the gridded data sets, and only in a few cases are these differences smoothed out when snow water equivalent is spatially averaged over the entire Alpine domain.",
      "ERA-Interim-driven RCM simulations show an annual snow cycle that is comparable in amplitude to those provided by the reference data sets, while GCM-driven RCMs present a large positive bias.",
      "RCMs and higher-resolution GCM simulations are used to provide an estimate of the snow reduction expected by the mid-21st century (RCP 8.5 scenario) compared to the historical climatology, with the main purpose of highlighting the limits of our current knowledge and the need for developing more reliable snow simulations."

Strategies to generate required tissues using embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are associated with either ethical or medical safety issues. An alternative strategy is to directly reprogram cells to the required tissue type by forced expression of cell fate-inducing transcription factors (TFs). Direct reprogramming (DR) has the potential to circumvent unsafe proliferative pluripotent cell stages and it allows in vivo procedures. However to date, DR is successful in only a few cell types and it is not well understood why most cells are refractory to DR. Recently, we provided evidence that inhibitory mechanisms play an important role in restricting cell fate conversion. We identified factors inhibiting direct conversion of germ cells into specific neurons or muscle cells. Additionally, preliminary studies in our group revealed other factors that inhibit ectopic cell fate induction in somatic cells. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to further understand mechanisms that restrict DR. We aim to identify and characterize factors involved in safeguarding differentiated cells and thereby counteract induction of ectopic fates in different cells. We use C. elegans as an in vivo model and apply large-scale forward and reverse genetic screenings with high-throughput. Next generation sequencing, tissue-specific biochemistry (ChIP-seq, SILAC) and 4D imaging will be used to elucidate the molecular function of identified DR-regulating factors. Finally, we will test the ability to convert cells in aged animals and assess the effects of ageing on the ability to induce ectopic cell fates.

Despite their importance, all proposed molecular models for transport are based on indirect evidence due to the inability of classical biophysical and biochemical techniques to directly visualize dynamic structural changes. To solve this problem, I suggest a novel approach that can decipher the molecular mechanisms of transport, with the ultimate goal to use this knowledge against pathogenic bacteria, for treatment of ABC-related diseases or multi-drug resistance of cancer cells.<br/>I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy for the study of conformational states of an ABC model system in vitro, and thus to observe directly how elementary transport steps are coordinated. This will open up a virtually unexplored biophysical research area and provide a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC transporters. The key questions of this proposal are:<br/><br/>Aim 1: What is the mechanism of substrate binding in ABC transporters? The conformational equilibrium (open vs. closed state) of ABC-associated substrate-binding proteins will be studied to understand the molecular mechanism of binding, i.e. induced fit vs. conformational selection.<br/><br/>Aim 2: What are relevant conformational states and changes for substrate translocation? The time- and length-scales of conformational changes in transmembrane and nucleotide binding domains as well as interactions with other domains will be characterized using the osmoregulator OpuA as a model system.<br/><br/>Aim 3: How are substrate binding, energy utilization and translocation coordinated in ABC transporters?
