# Machine-Learning-Content-Analytics-Argumentation-Mining


This project concerns Machine Learning Analysis on scientific papers and abstracts in order to predict their annotated labels.
We experimented on a dataset of around 2700 abstracts that were allready annotated with 3 different labels. The labels concerned the arguments of each abstract
and classified the sentences of the abstract in 3 categories: NEITHER, EVIDENCE and CLAIM.
